Media library. Every image and video in a store now lives in one place under Products → Media: browse it, search by file name, filter by type or by whether a file is in use, and upload files before deciding where they go. Picking a file from the library reuses it rather than copying it, so the same photo on three products is one file in storage.

The library is reachable from everywhere media is set. The product gallery gains "Add from library", category, collection and seller image fields gain "Choose from library", and the rich text editor can embed an image in a description for the first time. Category and collection images now appear in the library too, so a file uploaded there can be reused anywhere else.

Every file shows where it is used before it is deleted, and deleting one that is still in use removes it from those places once the merchant confirms.

New in `@spree/admin-sdk`: the `media` resource (`list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `usage`), `source_media_id` on product media creation for reuse, and `signed_id`, `embed_url`, `filename`, `content_type`, `byte_size` and `attached` on the admin media payload.
