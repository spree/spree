"@spree/dashboard": minor

Re-export the plugin facade (`defineDashboardPlugin` and its types) from `@spree/dashboard`, so host apps can register in-app customizations without declaring `@spree/dashboard-core` as a direct dependency. Distributed plugins keep importing from `@spree/dashboard-core/plugin`.
