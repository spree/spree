Align status badge colours with the Geist colour system: each of the success, warning, destructive and info variants now pairs a tint with a matching reading colour from the same hue, in both light and dark themes, and every variant meets WCAG AA against its own fill. Fixes a `warning` badge that changed colour entirely on hover, and an outline badge whose border never rendered.
