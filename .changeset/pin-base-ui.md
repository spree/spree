Pinned Base UI to an exact version so a scaffolded dashboard boots.

`@base-ui/react` was caret-ranged, so every new project installed whatever Base UI had published most recently rather than the version Spree tested against. `@base-ui/utils` 0.3.0 added a `useStore` helper that imports `useSyncExternalStore` by name from the CommonJS `use-sync-external-store` shim. Vite converts that during prebundling for an ordinary dependency, but `@spree/dashboard-ui` ships source, so an installed copy reached the browser with the named CommonJS import intact and the dashboard failed to start with a `SyntaxError`.

The monorepo's committed lockfile hid this — only fresh installs floated onto the newer Base UI. It is now pinned exactly, in the packages and as a workspace override, and the monorepo runs the same version a scaffold installs.
