Product galleries can hold video.

A media item now says what it is through `media_type`. `video` is a file you upload and serve yourself; `external_video` is a YouTube or Vimeo link. Both sit in the same gallery as images and reorder alongside them.

Spree reads the link when it is saved and rejects anything it cannot embed, so the media object comes back carrying `video_provider`, `video_embed_url`, `video_url` and `poster_url` — a storefront embeds a video without parsing links itself. A video's sized URLs resolve to its poster, so a gallery written for images still renders the right still.

`MediaCreateParams` and `MediaUpdateParams` accept `media_type`, `external_video_url`, `poster_signed_id` and the focal point. The `type` parameter, which named an internal Ruby class, is gone — `media_type` replaces it.

A video carries a **poster** — the still shown before it plays. Upload one with `poster_signed_id`, or leave it off and a YouTube link falls back to the provider's own image. Spree does not extract a frame from an uploaded file, so hosted video and Vimeo links want a poster.

In the dashboard, video files upload through the same drop zone as images, an "Add video link" button takes a YouTube or Vimeo URL, and the media editor plays the video back and takes a poster the merchant uploads. The editor also gains a focal-point picker: click the spot on an image that must stay in frame when a storefront crops it.

Choosing which variants a media item represents happens in one place — the media editor on the product. The unmounted variant-side gallery picker has been removed; it was a second way to edit the same thing.
