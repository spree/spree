Held Base UI at 1.5.0 so a scaffolded dashboard starts.

`@base-ui/react` 1.6.0 moved to `@base-ui/utils` 0.3.x, which added a `useStore` helper importing `useSyncExternalStore` **by name** from the CommonJS `use-sync-external-store` shim. Vite converts CommonJS while prebundling an ordinary dependency, but `@spree/dashboard-ui` ships source: in the Spree monorepo it is a workspace link that Vite crawls as application source, while an installed copy lives in `node_modules` and is not crawled. That file then reaches the browser with the named CommonJS import intact and the dashboard fails with a `SyntaxError` before rendering.

1.5.0 pins `@base-ui/utils` 0.2.9, which has no such file. The previous release pinned 1.8.0 — exact, but on the wrong side of the change — so this supersedes it.
