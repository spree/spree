Order numbers are now configurable from the dashboard.

**Settings → Store → Order numbers** controls how document numbers are shaped: the numbering format (sequential or random), the order number prefix and suffix, and the value the sequence starts at. A live preview shows what the next number will look like.

Sequential numbering is the new default — orders count up from 1001 (`R1001`, `R1002`) instead of carrying nine random digits. Merchants who would rather not disclose their order volume can switch the format back to random. Either way, changes apply to future orders only; numbers already issued never change.

`StoreUpdateParams` and the `Store` type gain `preferred_document_number_format`, `preferred_order_number_prefix`, `preferred_order_number_suffix` and `preferred_order_number_sequence_start`.
