h3. Theme extensions

Themes in Spree are implemented as extensions. Please refer to the "extensions guide":extensions.html for full details on using Spree extensions. This guide is concerned with features of extensions specific to altering the appearance of your store.

h4. Creating a theme extension

First, to generate the extension, run the following command:

<shell>
script/generate extension my_theme
</shell>

h4. Installing an existing extension

If the extension you want to install is available in a Git repository you can install it easily as follows:

<shell>
script/extension install git://github.com/username/your-theme.git
</shell>


h4. Load order

Each extension loaded by Spree will override the views and styleshets of those that preceed so you will need to configure their load order. Put something like the following inside the initializer block in the file +config/environment.rb+:

<shell>
config.extensions = [:all, :my_theme, :site]
</shell>




h3. Stylesheets

This part of the guide explains how override Spree's default stylesheets or add your own.

h4. Overriding Spree's stylesheets

h5. Less CSS

Spree uses "Less CSS":http://lesscss.org/ for its CSS. Less makes your CSS more maintainable with features such as variables and mixins while still supporting standard CSS syntax. 

Stylesheets are created in +app/stylesheets+ with the extension ".less" and are then compiled into ".css" files automatically.

Spree has a number of stylesheets for the front end of the site which are all compiled to the single file "screen.css" to improve site performance. These files are as follows:

<shell>
  _buttons.less
  _cart.less
  _checkout_progress.less
  _checkout.less
  _colors.less
  _forms.less
  _layout.less
  _messages.less
  _mixins.less
  _navigation.less
  _prices.less
  _product_details.less
  _product_lists.less
  _registration.less
  _reset.less
  _typography.less
  screen.less
</shell>

The "_" file prefix denotes a partial stylesheet. These are all included into the main stylesheet "screen.less" on compilation using the +@import+ directive:

<shell>
  @import "_reset";
</shell>

To override any of these stylesheets, create a file of the same name within your extensions +app/stylesheets+ directory. For example, if you just wanted to change some of the colours used in the default theme you would just create a copy of +_colors.less+ in your +app/stylesheets+ directory.



h4. Custom stylesheets

h5. Using preferences to specify stylesheets to load

By default Spree will only load +/stylesheets/screen.css+ into the main layout. Rather than override the layout template you can load your custom stylesheet by editing +SITE_EXTENSION_DIR/my_theme_extension.rb+ and changing  the existing +activate+ method to the following:

<shell>
def activate
  AppConfiguration.class_eval do
    preference :stylesheets, :string, :default => 'screen,my_theme'
  end
end
</shell>

This would load screen.css first followed by my_theme.css.


h5. Customizing the contents of the head tag

To have full control over the stylesheets used in your theme, as well as JavaScripts, you can override the template +app/views/shared/_head.html.erb+ which includes all the contents of the head tag. See "Customizing Templates":#customizingtemplates

If you just need to add your own content to what the head already contains, you can use the theme hook "head". See "Hooks":#hooks for details.


h3. Images and other assets

h4. Adding your own images, JavaScripts and other assets

Any static asset your theme requires should be placed in +SITE_EXTENSION_DIR/public+. These will be copied into +RAILS_ROOT/public+ when you start the application.

h4. Using a Custom Logo

If you're overriding the main application layout (+spree_application.html.erb+) you can place your logo image in there. However it is possible  to change the logo without overriding this template using preferences as follows:

<code>
  AppConfiguration.class_eval do
    preference :logo, :string, :default => '/images/my_logo_.png'
  end
</code>



h3. Hooks

Hooks are a way of inserting your own content into pre-defined parts of Spree's default templates without having to make your own copy of those templates in your extension. 

h4. Available hooks

Hooks are available to let you add content after product lists, within sidebars and other useful places.A full list of available hooks is available "here":hooks.html

h4. Using hooks

In your extension directory you should find the file +my_theme_hooks.rb+.  Within this file you can specify which content should be inserted into which hooks.

h5. Option 1

Supply the hook name as a symbol followed by any arguments that are valid for 'render'

To use contents of your own partial template:

<shell>
  render_on :homepage_above_products, 'shared/welcome'
</shell>

To just insert a small string:

<shell>
  render_on :homepage_above_products, :text => "<h1>Welcome!</h1>"
</shell>

h5. Option 2, block syntax

You can suppy a block to +render_on+ which returns the string to be inserted. You can use any helpers you would
use in your views in this block.

The following would add a link below product details:

<shell> 
  render_on :product_below_description do
    '<p>' + link_to('Back to products', products_path) + '</p>'
   end
</shell>

This example would add a new tab to the admin navigation.

<shell> 
   render_on :admin_tabs do
     tab(:taxonomies)
   end
</shell>

<shell>
  <%= call_hook :my_hook_name %>
</shell>


h3. Customizing templates

h4. Overriding Spree default views

To override any of of Spree's default views, including those for the admin interface, simply create a file with the same filename in your extensions +views+ directory.

For example, to override the main layout, create the file +SITE_EXTENSION_DIR/app/views/layouts/spree_application.html.erb+

h4. Using hooks in your templates

Since themes are just Spree extensions, one may be loaded after another, the modifications they make to the site's appearance being combined based on their load order.  If you anticipate your theme being extended by other themes you should make sure your templates maintain the standard hooks where possible so subsequently loaded extensions can make use of them. You may also define new hooks using the +call_hook+ helper like so:

<shell>
  <%= call_hook :my_hook_name %>
</shell>

If your theme adds new hooks these should be documented in your theme's README.
