h2. REST API

This guide covers the inner working of Spree's RESTful API.  It assumes a basic understanding of the principles of "REST":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer. More specifically, the guide will provide information on the following:

* The various resources available through the API
* How to make a basic API call
* Specific examples on how to access certain resources
* Tools and other suggestions for working with the API

endprologue.

WARNING: We now have a dedicated online resource with very detailed information on the REST API.  Be sure to check out the "Spree API Website":http://api.spreecommerce.com for more details.

h3. Overview

The REST API is designed to give developers a convenient way to access data contained within Spree.  With a standard read/write interface to store data, it is now very simple to write third party applications (ex. iPhone) that can talk to Spree.  It is also possible to build sophisticated "middleware":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware applications that can serve as a bridge between Spree and a warehouse or inventory system.

h3. Available Resources

INFO: The API currently only supports a limited number of resources.  The current list reflects the needs of paying clients who funded the development of the API.  The list will be expanded soon to cover additional resources.  Adding more resources is simply a matter of making the time for testing and investigating possible security implications.

Spree currently supports RESTful access to the following resources:

* Products
* Variants
* Orders
* Line Items

h3. JSON Data

Developers communicate with the Spree API using the "JSON":http://www.json.org/ data format.  Requests for data are communicated in the standard manner using the HTTP protocol.

For example, the request +GET /api/products/a-product.json+ will produce output similar to the following:

<plain>
{
  "product": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A product",
    "price": "19.99",
    "available_on": "2011-03-23T21:11:50Z",
    "permalink", "a-product"
  }
}
</plain>


h3. Making an API Call

h4. Authentication

You will need an authentication token to access the API. These keys can be generated on the user edit screen within the admin interface. To make a request to the API, pass a +X-Spree-Token+ header along with the request:

<shell>
curl --header "X-Spree-Token: YOUR_KEY_HERE" http://example.com/api/products.json
</shell>

Alternatively, you may also pass through the token as a parameter in the request if a header just won't suit your purposes (i.e. JavaScript console debugging).

<shell>
curl http://example.com/api/products.json?token=YOUR_KEY_HERE
</shell>

The token allows the request to assume the same level of permissions as the actual user to whom the token belongs.

h4. Other Supported Formats

Currently the API supports only the "JSON":http://www.json.org/ format.

INFO: Supporting the XML format should not be difficult since Rails supports it out of the box.  Volunteers who are willing to provide a patch (and tests) for XML support are encouraged to do so.

h3. API Reference

WARNING: We now have a dedicated online resource with very detailed information on the REST API.  Be sure to check out the "Spree API Website":http://api.spreecommerce.com for more details.

h4. API Rules

* All successful requests for the API will return a status of 200.
* Successful create and update requests will result in a status of 201 and 200 respectively.
* Both create and update requests will return Spree's representation of the data upon success.
* If a create or update request fails, a status code of 422 will be returned, with a hash containing an "error" key, and an "errors" key. The errors value will contain all ActiveRecord validation errors encounterd when saving this record.
* Delete requests will return status of 200, and no content.
* Requests that list collections, such as +/api/products+ will return a limited result set back.
* Requests that list collections can be paginated through by passing a +page+ parameter that is a number greater than 0.
* If a resource can not be found, the API will return a status of 404.
* Unauthorized requests will be met with a 401 response.
