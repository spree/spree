h2. Preferences

This guide covers how to manage and configure preferences within Spree. After reading it, you should be familiar with:

* How preferences are managed by Spree
* How to change the value of a preference from its default
* How to add a new preference to the Spree core
* How to create a new set of preferences for your custom extensions.

h3. Overview

The Spree preference system adds support for easily creating custom preferences for models. It's simply an adoption of the "preferences plugin":http://github.com/pluginaweek/preferences/tree/master, and much of the following material is derived from that plugin's documentation.

This original preferences plugin required another plugin (plugins_plus), which was something like the Spree extensions system. So we just added the preferences functionality to the Spree core, and it can now be used by both the Spree core as well as extensions to store preferences.

The first several sections of this guide describe preferences in a very general way.  If you're just interested in making modifications to the existing preferences, you can skip ahead to the "Configuring Spree Preferences":#configuring-spree-preferences section.  If you would like a more in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts used by the preference system, please read on.

h3. Motivation

Preferences for models within an application, such as for users, represent a common use case. Although the rule of thumb is to keep the number of preferences available to a minimum, sometimes it's necessary if you want users to be able to disable things like e-mail notifications.

Generally, basic preferences can be accomplished through simple designs, such as additional columns or a bit vector such as that described and implemented by "preference_fu":http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/preferencefu.

However, as you find the need for non-binary preferences and the number of preferences becomes unmanageable as individual columns in the database, the next step is often to create a separate +preferences+ table. This is where a more sophisticated preferences system comes in.  Spree encapsulates this design by hiding the fact that preferences are stored in a separate table and making it dead-simple to define and manage preferences.

h3. Persisting Modifications to Preferences

Although you can change settings from +script/console+ or from the admin interface, you should realize
that these settings will be lost should you decide to rebuild your database. You might also be missing
these settings in your production server once you promote your code.

IMPORTANT. You should consider using seed data or initializers to configure your application and to enforce important settings.  See the "Extensions guide":extensions.html#extensioninitializers for more details.


h3. Usage

h4. Defining Preferences

You can define preferences for a model within the model itself:

<shell>
 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   preference :hot_salsa
   preference :dark_chocolate, :default => true
   preference :color, :string
   preference :favorite_number
   preference :language, :string, :default => 'English'
 end
</shell>

In the above model, five preferences have been defined:

* hot_salsa
* dark_chocolate
* color
* favorite_number
* language

For each preference, a data type and default value can be specified. If no data type is given, it's considered a boolean value. If no default value is given, the default is assumed to be nil.

h3. Accessing preferences

Once preferences have been defined for a model, they can be accessed either using the shortcut methods that are generated for each preference or the generic methods that are not specific to a particular preference.

h4. Shortcut methods

There are several shortcut methods that are generated. They are shown below.

Query methods:

<shell>
 user.prefers_hot_salsa?         # => false
 user.prefers_dark_chocolate?    # => false
</shell>

Reader methods:

<shell>
 user.preferred_color      # => nil
 user.preferred_language   # => "English"
</shell>

Writer methods:

<shell>
 user.prefers_hot_salsa = false        # => false
 user.preferred_language = 'English'   # => "English"
</shell>

h4. Generic methods

Each shortcut method is essentially a wrapper for the various generic methods shown below:

Query method:

<shell>
 user.prefers?(:hot_salsa)       # => false
 user.prefers?(:dark_chocolate)  # => false
</shell>

Reader method:

<shell>
 user.preferred(:color)      # => nil
 user.preferred(:language)   # => "English"
</shell>

Write method:

<shell>
 user.set_preference(:hot_salsa, false)      # => false
 user.set_preference(:language, "English")   # => "English"
</shell>

h4. Accessing all preferences

To get the collection of all custom, stored preferences for a particular record, you can access the +stored_preferences+ has_many association which is automatically generated:

<shell>
 user.stored_preferences
</shell>

In addition to this, you can get a hash of all stored preferences *and* default preferences, by accessing the +preferences+ helper:

<shell>
 user.preferences  # => {"language"=>"English", "color"=>nil}
</shell>

This hash will contain the value for every preference that has been defined for the model, whether that's the default value or one that has been previously stored.

A short-hand alternative for preferences is also available:

<shell>
 user.prefs  # => {"language"=>"English", "color"=>nil}
</shell>

h3. Grouping preferences

In addition to defining generic preferences for the owning record, you can also group preferences by ActiveRecord objects or arbitrary names.  This is best shown through an example:

<shell>
 user = User.find(:first)
 car = Car.find(:first)

 user.preferred_color = 'red', car       # or you can use
 user.set_preference(:color, 'red', car) # the generic way
</shell>

This will create a preference for the color _red_ for the given _car_. In this way, you can have _color_ preferences for different records.

To access the preference for a particular record, you can use the same accessor methods as before:

<shell>
 user.preferred_color(car)   # or use
 user.preferred(:color, car) # the generic way
</shell>

In addition to grouping preferences for a particular record, you can also group preferences by name. For example,

<shell>
 user = User.find(:first)

 user.preferred_color = 'red', 'automobiles'
 user.preferred_color = 'tan', 'clothing'

 user.preferred_color('automobiles')   # => "red"
 user.preferred_color('clothing')      # => "tan"

 user.preferences                # => {"color"=>nil, "automobiles"=>{"color"=>"red"}, "clothing=>{"color=>"tan"}}
 user.preferences('automobiles') # => {"color"=>"red"}
</shell>

h3. Saving preferences

Note that preferences are not saved until the owning record is saved. Preferences are treated in a similar fashion to attributes. For example,

<shell>
 user = user.find(:first)
 user.attributes = {:preferred_color => 'red'}
 user.save!
</shell>

Preferences are stored in a separate table called +preferences+.

h3. Configuring Spree Preferences

Up until now we've been discussing the general preference system that was adapted to Spree.  This has given you a general idea of what types of preference features are theoretically supported.  Now, let's start to look specifically at how Spree is using these preferences for configuration.

h4. Reading the Current Preferences

At the heart of Spree preferences lies the +Spree::Config+ module.  This module provides general access to the configuration settings anywhere in the application.  These settings can be accessed from initializers, models, controllers, views, etc.  The +Spree::Config+ module returns a singleton instance of the +AppConfiguration+ model which is where the default values for all of the general Spree preferences are defined.

You can access these preferences using a convenient hash notation.  To see this in action, just fire up +script/console+ and try the following.

<shell>
  >> Spree::Config[:site_name]
  => "Spree Demo Site"
  >> Spree::Config[:default_locale]
  => "en-US"
</shell>

The above examples show the default configuration values for these preferences.  The defaults themselves are coded within the +AppConfiguration+ model.

<shell>
  class AppConfiguration < Configuration
    #... snip ...
    preference :site_name, :string, :default => 'Spree Demo Site'
    #... snip ...
    preference :default_locale, :string, :default => 'en-US'
    #... snip ...
  end
</shell>

If you are using the default preferences without any modifications, then there is actually nothing to store in the +preferences+ table of the database.  Let's verify that it is empty.

<shell>
  $ script/dbconsole
  sqlite> SELECT * FROM preferences;
</shell>

h4. Overriding the Default Preferences

The default Spree preferences in +AppConfiguration+ can be changed using the +set+ method of the +Spree::Config+ module.  For example to set the default locale for Spain we could do the following:

<shell>
  $ script/console
  >> Spree::Config.set(:default_locale => "es")
  => nil
  >> Spree::Config[:default_locale]
  => "es"
</shell>

Here we are changing a preference to something other then the default as specified in +AppConfiguration+. In this case the preference system will persist the new value in the +preferences+ table.

<shell>
  $ script/dbconsole
  sqlite> SELECT * FROM preferences;
  1|default_locale|1|Configuration|||es|2009-05-04 22:30:17|2009-05-04 22:30:17
</shell>

INFO: Console settings may be lost if the database is rebuilt. See the "advice above":#persisting-modificationsto-preferences about preservation of settings.

h4. Configuration Through the Admin Interface

The Spree admin interface has several different screens where various settings can be configured.  For instance, the +admin/general_settings+ URL in your Spree application can be used to configure the values for the site name and the site URL.  This is basically equivalent to calling +Spree::Config.set(:site_name => "Whatever", :site_url => "http://whatever.com")+ directly in your Ruby code.

Many of the configuration settings are not editable from an admin screen.  This was basically put on hold during the refactoring of the admin interface.  Now that things have stabilized we'll be adding the missing settings in the near future.  However, all of the settings can be changed through Ruby code (e.g. in initializers).

INFO: Admin interface settings may be lost if the database is rebuilt. See the "advice above":#persisting-modifications-to-preferences about preservation of settings. However, you may want to make an exception for sensitive data, i.e. to enter gateway passwords directly and not store them in the code repository.
