h3. Existing Search Engine Optimization Features

Chapter 1 contains a description of the work that has been completed to address common search engine optimization issues.

h4. Relevant, Meaningful URLs

The helper method <tt>seo_url(taxon, product)</tt> yields SEO friendly URLs such as "demo.spreecommerce.com/products/xm-direct2-interface-adapter":http://demo.spreecommerce.com/products/xm-direct2-interface-adapter and "demo.spreecommerce.com/t/categories/headphones":http://demo.spreecommerce.com/t/categories/headphones. Each controller is configured to serve the content using these keyword relevant, meaningful URLs.

h4. On Page Keyword Targeting

Several enhancements have been made to improve on-page keyword targeting. The admin interface provides the ability to manage meta descriptions and meta keywords at the product level. Additionally, H1 tags are used throughout the site for product and taxonomy names. The ease of extension development of layout changes allows you to target keywords throughout the site.

h4. Clean Content

Spree uses Skeleton, a responsive CSS framework that allows clean HTML that also responds well to any screen size. Having clean HTML with minimal inline JavaScript and CSS is considered to be a factor in search engine optimization.

h4. On Site Performance Optimization

Spree has been configured to serve one CSS and one JavaScript file on every page (excluding extension inclusions). Minimizing HTTP requests is considered an important factor in search engine optimization as the server performance is an important influence in the search engine crawl behavior for a site.

h4. Google Analytics integration

Google Analytics has been integrated into the Spree core and can be managed from the "Analytics Trackers" section of the admin. Google Analytics is not included on your store if this preference is not set. The Google Analytics setup includes e-commerce conversion tracking. 

h3. Planned Search Engine Optimization Features

Although several common search engine optimization issues have been addressed, we are always looking for the new best practices in SEO. Contributions to address issues will be very welcome. Visit the "contributing to spree section":contributing_to_spree.html to learn more about contributing.

h4. Product and Taxonomy Page Title Enhancements

Page titles are an important part of search engine optimization and should be meaningful and relevant to the page content. There are a few configuration settings for getting the best page titles possible. "Site Name" will appear in the beginning of each of your titles. When possible, we assign an appropriate title after that (product name, taxon name, etc), but when we can't do that, we use the "Default Seo Title".

h4. Alt Attribute on Product Images

The alt attribute on product images currently pulls data from product titles or the image filename. Enhancing the image alt tag can improve image search performance.

h4. Known Duplicate Content Issues

In the Spree demo, it is a known issue that "demo.spreecommerce.com":http://demo.spreecommerce.com/ contains duplicate content to "demo.spreecommerce.com/products":http://demo.spreecommerce.com/products. Duplicate content can be a detriment to search engine performance as external links are divided among duplicate content pages. As a result, duplicate content pages may not only not be excluded from the main search engine index, but pages may also rank poorly in comparison to other sites where all external links go to one non-duplicated page.

h4. Integration of Content Management System or Content

There has been quite a bit of interest in development of "CMS integration into Spree":http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user/search?q=cms. Having good content is an important part of search engine optimization, as it not only can improve on page keyword targeting, but it also can improve the popularity of a site which can in turn improve search engine optimization.

h4. Tool Integration

In addition to integration of Google Analytics, several other tools can be implemented for SEO purposes such as Bing Webmaster Tools, Google Webmaster Tools and Quantcast. Social media optimization tools such as Pinterest, Reddit, Digg, Delicious, Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter may also be integrated to improve social networking site performance.

h3. Spree SEO Extensions

The following list shows extensions that can improve search engine performance. Refer to the GitHub README for developer notes.

h3. External Search Engine Optimization Efforts

Spree cannot control factors such as external links, quality of external links, server performance and capabilities. These areas should not be ignored in implementation of search engine optimization efforts.
