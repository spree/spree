h3. Managing Customizations

Spree supports three methods for managing and organizing your customizations. While they all support exactly the same options for customization they differ in terms of re-usability. So before you get started you need to decide what sort of customizations you are going to make.

h4. Application Specific

Application specific customizations are the most common type of customization applied to Spree. It's generally used by developers and designers to tweak Spree's behaviour or appearance to match a particular business's operating procedures, branding, or provide a unique feature.

All application specific customizations are stored within the host application where Spree is installed (please see the Installation section of the "Getting Started with Spree":getting_started.html guide, for how to setup the host application). Application customizations are not generally shared or re-used in anyway.

h4. Extension

Extensions enable developers to enhance or add functionality to Spree, and are generally discrete pieces of functionality that are shared and intended to be installed in multiple Spree implementations.

Extensions are generally distributed as ruby gems and implemented as standard Rails 3 engines so they provide a natural way to bundle all the changes needed to implement larger features.

Visit the "Extension Registry":http://spreecommerce.com/extensions to get an idea of the type and volume of extensions available.

h4. Theme

Themes are designed to overhaul the entire look and feel of a Spree store (or its administration system). Themes are distributed in exactly the same manner as extensions, but don't generally include logic customizations.

INFO: For more implementation details on Extensions and Themes please refer to the "Extensions & Themes":extensions.html guide.

h3. Customization Options

Once you've decided how you're going to manage your customizations, you then need to choose the correct option to achieve the desired changes.

h4. View Customizations

Allows you to change and/or extend the look and feel of a Spree store (and its administration system). For details see the "View Customization":view_customization.html guide.

h4. Asset Customizations

Allows changing the static assets provided by Spree, this includes stylesheets, JavaScript files and images. For details see the "Asset Customization":asset_customization.html guide.

h4. Logic Customizations

Enables the changing and/or extension of the logic of Spree to meet your specific business requirements. For details see the "Logic Customization":logic_customization.html guide.
