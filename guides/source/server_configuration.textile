h2. Overview & Deployment Options

This guide will discuss the requirements and options for deploying Spree in production and staging environments. After reading it, you should be familiar with:

* Common server configurations used when deploying Spree.
* How memory availability affects Spree's performance and scalability
* Typical memory footprints for Spree servers.

h3. Overview

Spree can be deployed like any other Rails application using any combination of the usual software components like Apache, Nginx, Unicorn, Passenger, Ruby, Capistrano etc.

Normally the first concern when deploying your store is choosing the correct software stack, server sizes and roles. 

Using the "Spree Deployment Service":deployment_service.html you can avoid the hassle of choosing and configuring all the individual components, and jump straight to getting your application deployed using our preconfigured and tested software stack. 

For more see the "Deployment Service":deployment_service.html Guide.

INFO: This guide assumes basic familiarity with Spree. Please refer to the "Getting Started Guide":/getting_started.html for details on how to get up and running for Spree.  You will have an easier time understanding the extra complications of a production setup.


h3. Server Sizing & Configurations

While most smaller Spree installations can operate extremely well on relatively modest single server configurations, stores that need to handle a larger number of concurrent users frequently chose a multi-server configuration to distribute the workload and simplify server configurations. 

NOTE: Determining how many concurrent users any server configuration is capable of handling is entirely dependant on the specific application and its use of extensions and customizations. All server sizing guidelines provided here are purely estimates based on basic Spree instances.


h4. Memory (RAM) requirements

Spree's scalability (like most Rails applications) is directly affected by number of application worker processes available to handle requests as they arrive. The number of worker processes you can configure for a given server is directly related the amount of RAM available.

INFO: The *Spree Deployment Service* allows you to configure the number of unicorn workers deployed on each application server.

h4. Single Server

Single server configurations are well suited to low volume Spree production installations, or staging / qa environments. Single server configurations include both the application and database software components running on a single host, and generally need to be configured to run less workers to allow some free memory for the database component.

h5. Suggested initial memory & worker values

These values are guidelines for the minimum requirements for a single server production environment. Staging and QA can perform acceptably with less resources, generally half of what is listed below.

|_.Spree Version|_.RAM (minimum)|_.Unicorn Workers|
|1.0.0|1024MB|2-4|
|0.70.x|1024MB|2-4|
|0.60.x|1024MB|2-4|
|0.11.x|512MB|2-3|

WARNING: Adding too many workers for the amount of available memory will have a negative effect on overall performance so it's important to get the worker count correct for your application / memory combination.

h4. Multi-Server

When you separate your Spree application on multiple servers, generally one or more servers are configured as dedicated application servers and one server is configured as a dedicated database server.

h5. Suggested initial memory & worker values

These values are guidelines for the minimum requirements for each Application Server in a production environment. 

|_.Spree Version|_.RAM (minimum)|_.Unicorn Workers|
|1.0.0|512MB|3-5|
|0.70.x|512MB|3-5|
|0.60.x|512MB|3-5|
|0.11.x|512MB|2-4|

Database servers for use in multi-server configurations generally require a minimum of 512MB RAM when serving one or two applicaiton servers, however this should be increased when more or larger capacity application servers are used.
