h2. Taxation

Spree has an extremely flexible system for tax calculation. After reading this guide you should have an understanding of the following:

* Setting up tax categories and zones
* Configuring sales tax and/or price inclusive taxes
* Using alternative methods to compute tax

endprologue.

h3. Overview

The standard sales tax policies commonly found in the USA can be modeled as well as Value Added Tax (VAT) which is commonly used in Europe. These are not the only types of tax rules that you can model in Spree.  Once you obtain a sufficient understanding of the basic concepts you should be able to model the tax rules of your country or jurisdiction.

WARNING: There were major changes to Spree taxation in the 1.0 release. If you have an existing store on a prior version of Spree then you should consult the "Version 1.0 Release Notes":release_notes_1_0_0.html.

h3. Basic Concepts

h4. Tax Categories

The Spree default is to treat everything as exempt from tax. In order for a product to be considered taxable, it must belong to a tax category. The tax category is a special concept that is specific to taxation. It has nothing to do with the categories (taxonomies) that users use to navigate through your store. The tax category is normally never seen by the user so you could call it something generic like "Taxable Goods." If you wish to tax certain products at different rates, however, then you will want to choose something more descriptive (ex. "Clothing.").

NOTE: It can be somewhat tedious to set the tax category for every product. We're currently exploring ways to make this simpler. If you are importing inventory from another source you will likely be writing your own custom Ruby program that automates this process.

h4. Zones

You must also create a tax zone before your products can be taxed. A tax zone is a geographical area where products are shipped to. If an order is being shipped to somewhere within the zone, then it will be taxed at the appropriate rate. You will need to create one zone for each different geographic area you need to account for when determining tax.

h5. Basic Examples

Lets say you need to charge 5% tax for all items that ship to New York and 6% on only clothing items that ship to Pennsylvania. This will mean you need to construct two different zones.  One zone containing just the state of New York and another zone consistng of the single state of Pennsylvania.

Here's another hypothetical scenario.  You would like to charge 10% tax on all electronic items and 5% tax on everything else. This tax should apply to all countries in the European Union (EU.) In this case you would construct just a single zone consisting of all the countries in the EU. The fact that you want to charge two different rates depending on the type of good does not mean you need two zones.

INFO: Please see the "Zones Guide":zones.html for more information on constructing a zone.

h5. Default Tax Zone

Spree also has the concept of a default tax zone. When a user is adding items to their cart we do not yet know where the order will be shipped to. In some cases we may want to estimate the tax for the order by assuming the order falls within a particular tax zone.

Why might we want to do this? The primary use case for this is for countries where there is already tax included in the price. In the EU, for example, most products have a Value Added Tax (VAT) included in the price. There are cases where it may be desirable to show the portion of the product price that includes tax. In order to calculate this tax amount we need to know the zone (and corresponding Tax Rate) that was assumed in the price.

We may also reduce the order total by the tax amount if the order is being shipped outside the tax jurisdiction. Again, this requires us to know the zone assumed in making the orginal tax calculation so that the tax amount can be backed out.

INFO: For more information on VAT and other similar scenarios see the "Tax Included":#tax-included section of this guide.

h5. Shipping vs. Billing Address

Most tax jurisdictions base the tax on the shipping address of where the order is being shipped to. So in these cases the shipping address is used when determining the tax zone. Spree does, however, allow you to use the billing address to determine the zone.

To determine tax based on billing address instead of shipping address you will need to set the @tax_using_ship_address@ preference to @false@.

INFO: See the "Preferences Guide":preferences.html for more information on setting preferences.

NOTE: @Zone.match@ will return the zone that best matches the address used for taxation. In the case of multiple matches, the closer match will be used with State zone matches having priority over Country zone matches.

h4. Calculators

In order to charge tax in Spree you also need a @Calculator@. In most cases you should be able to use Spree's @DefaultTax@ calculator. It is suitable for both sales tax and price-inclusive tax scenarios.

NOTE: The @DefaultTax@ calculator uses the item total (exclusive of shipping) when computing sales tax.

It is also possible to code your own @Calculator@ models in Spree if the @DefaultTax@ calcuator is not sufficient for your needs. You will need to register the calculator with Spree in order to make it available in the user interface when setting up  your tax rates.

For reference, this is how Spree currently performs the registration:

<ruby filename="lib/spree/core/engine.rb">
  initializer "spree.register.calculators" do |app|
    # snip
    app.config.spree.calculators.tax_rates =
      [Spree::Calculator::DefaultTax]
  end
</ruby>

h4. Tax Rates

Tax rates are set up through the admin interface (Configurations | Tax Rates). A tax rate is essentially a percentage amount charged based on the sales price. Tax rates also contain other important information.

* Whether product prices are inlusive of this tax
* The zone in which the order address must fall within
* The tax category that a product must belong to in order to be considered taxable.

Spree will calculate tax based on the best matching zone for the order. Its also possible to have more than one applicable tax rate for a single zone. In order for a tax rate to apply to a particular product, that product must have a tax category that matches the tax category of the tax rate.

h3. Tax Types

There are two basic types of tax that a store owner might need to contend with. In the United States (and some other countries) store owners sometimes need to charge what is known as "sales tax." In the European Union (EU) and other countries stores owners need to deal with "tax inclusive" pricing which is often called Value Added Tax (VAT.)

NOTE: Most taxes can be considered one of these two types. For instance, in Australia customers pay a Goods and Services Tax (GST.) This is basically equivalent to VAT in Europe.

In some cases you may need to charge one type of tax for orders falling within one zone and another type of tax for orders falling within a different zone.  There are even some rare situations where need to charge both types of tax in the same zone. Spree supports all of these scenarios.

h4. Sales Tax

Sales tax is the default tax type for any tax rate in Spree. Its the simplest type of tax to calculate and it is the method by which your tax will be determined assuming you leave the "Included in Price" checkbox unchecked.

Lets take an example of a 5% tax on clothing items for a zone that covers all of North America. If the customer purchases a single clothing item for $17.99 and they live in the United States (which is within the North America zone we defined) they are eligible to pay sales tax.

The sales tax calculation is $17.99 x 0.05 for a total tax of $0.90. Note that in the case of sales tax the tax is added to the item total an adjustment.

INFO: See the "Adjustments Guide":adjustments.html if you need more information on adjustments.

Now lets change the quantity on that clothing item from 1 to 2. The tax is now $35.98 x 0.05 for a total of $1.80.

!images/taxes/sales_tax_applied2.png(Sales Tax Applied)!

Now lets add a coffee mug that costs $13.99 to the order. Since the coffe mug is not clothing its not taxable. The tax total therefore should not change ($35.98 x 0.05)

!images/taxes/sales_tax_applied3.png(Sales Tax Applied)!

Finally, if we change the order address to Ireland (which is outside of the tax zone) we see that sales tax is no longer applied.

h4. Tax Included

Many jurisdictions have what is commonly referred to as a Value Added Tax (VAT.) In these cases the tax is typically applied to the price. This means that prices for items are "inclusive of tax" and no additional tax needs to be applied during checkout.

In the case of tax inclusive pricing the store owner should enter all prices inclusive of tax. This makes it easy for Spree to display the tax inclusive price since it won't have to be constantly calculated on the fly.

NOTE: Keep in mind that each order records the price a customer paid (including the tax) as part of the line item record. This means you don't have to worry about changing prices or tax rates affecting older orders.

If you are going designate one or more tax rates as being included in the price then you must first set up a default tax zone. Spree will not allow you to proceed without performing this step. This default zone is needed in cases where a customer might not be eligible to pay the tax.

INFO: You must choose a default tax zone if you are going to mark at a tax rate as being included in your product prices.

WARNING: Prior versions of Spree handled VAT differently. If you are upgrading to version 1.0 or higher you should make sure your prices include tax.

When tax is included in the price there is no order adjustment needed (unlike the sales tax case.) Stores are, however, typically interested in showing the amount of tax the user paid. These totals are for informational purposes only and do not affect the order total.

Lets start by looking at an example where there is a 5% included on all products and its included in the price. We'll further assume that this tax should only apply to orders within the United Kingdom (UK).

In the case where the order address is within the UK and we purchase a single clothing item for £17.99 we see an order total of £17.99. We also see an additional line included for the customer's reference that shows they paid a total of £0.90 in tax.

!images/taxes/vat_tax_breakout.png(VAT tax breakout)!

INFO: Notice how the tax is included below the order total. This is because the tax line is for informational purposes only and does not affect the actual total of the order.

NOTE: These informational totals are considered adjustments to the @LineItem@ class. This allows us to preserve them for reporting purposes and to avoid including them in the @Order#adjustment_total@.

Now lets increase the quantity on the item from 1 to 2. The order total changes to £35.98 with a tax total of £1.80.

!images/taxes/vat_tax_breakout2.png(VAT tax breakout)!

Next we'll add a different clothing item costing £19.99 to our order. The order total increases to £55.97 but also notice that there is still just a single item for the clothing tax showing £2.80. Since both items are clothing and taxed at the same rate so they can be reduced to a single total.

!images/taxes/vat_tax_breakout3.png(VAT tax breakout)!

Now lets assume an additional tax rate of 10% on consumer electronics. When we add a product of this category to our order with a price of £16.99 we will now also see a second tax total of £1.70.

!images/taxes/vat_tax_breakout4.png(VAT tax breakout)!

Finally, let's see what happens when we change our order to have an address in the United States and therefore not included in the UK tax zone we have defined. In this case Spree will create two negative adjustments for £2.80 and £1.70 which effectively reduces the order total to £68.46.

h3. Additional Examples

WARNING: All of the examples in this guide are meant to be used for illustrative purposes. They are not meant to be used as definitive intepretations of tax law. You should consult your accountant or attorney for guidance on how much tax to collect and under what circumstances.

h4. Quebec Sales Tax (QST)

In Quebec, Canada there are two different tax rates to consider. There is the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which iscalculated at 5% of the sales price. There is also the Quebec Sales Tax of 9.5% on the sale price including GST.

Since Spree does not currently support the notion of compound tax rates you can calculated a combined sales tax amount instead. In this case you can create a single sales tax rate of 9.975%. This approach is allowed "according to the Quebec government":http://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/entreprise/taxes/tvq_tps/hausse-taux-tvq-2012-01-01/indication-calcul-taxes.aspx as long as you label the tax simply as "QST" and do not display the percentage used in the calculation as part of the label.
