## Major/New Features

### Store Credit ?

### Versioned API

While we've already had the ability to version our API we weren't making use of it.
Now that we're beginning to write a new API we've added a v1 namespace,
and default routing /api requests to use /api/v1.  The /api/v2 will be opt-in
likely until we feel it is complete, and have deprecated /api/v1 (likely for Spree 4).

## Upgrade

### Update Gemfile & Run Migrations

### Other Gotchas

#### Make sure to v1 namespace custom rabl templates & overrides.

If you're rabl templates reference others with extend you'll need to add the v1 namespace.

For example:
```ruby
extends 'spree/api/zones/show'
```

Becomes:
```ruby
extends 'spree/api/v1/zones/show'
```
