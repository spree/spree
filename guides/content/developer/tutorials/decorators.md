## Introduction

Seems like it would make sense to port the content from the old [Logic Customization Page](http://http://guides.spreecommerce.com/logic_customization.html) here

A decorator is used as an example in [Extensions](../extensions_tutorial/) but this could go into more detail, including examples of controller decorators and how to test them.
