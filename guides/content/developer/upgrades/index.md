## Upgrade Guides

We strongly advise upgrading Spree incrementally, rather than in one big go. For example, if you're upgrading a Spree store from 0.60.x to 2.2.x, you would read through all of these guides, one by one. 

If there are any issues with these guides, please let us know by [filing an issue on our guides repo](https://github.com/spree/spree-guides/issues/new)

* [0.60.x to 0.70.x](/developer/upgrades/point-sixty-to-point-seventy)
* [0.70.x to 1.0.x](/developer/upgrades/point-seventy-to-one-dot-oh)
* [1.0.x to 1.1.x](/developer/upgrades/one-dot-oh-to-one-dot-one)
* [1.1.x to 1.2.x](/developer/upgrades/one-dot-one-to-one-dot-two)
