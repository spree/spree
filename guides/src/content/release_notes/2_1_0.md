## Major/new features

### Rails 4 compatibility

Spree 2.1.0 is the first Spree release which is Rails 4 compatible. Go ahead, try it out!

### Breaking API changes

Spree's API component has undergone some work to make it easier to build JavaScript-backed frontends. For example, our [experimental Spree+Marionette project](https://github.com/radar/spree-marionette).

As a result, we have altered some parts of the API to make this process easier. Please check the API changelog below to see if anything in there affects you.

### Better Spree PayPal Express extension

We now have a [better Spree PayPal Express](https://github.com/radar/better_spree_paypal_express) extension which is fully compatible with this release. If you are looking for PayPal Express Checkout integration for your new Spree store, check out this extension.

## API

- The Products API endpoint now returns an additional key called `shipping_category_id`, and also requires `shipping_category_id` on create.

  _Jeff Dutil_

- The Products API endpoint now returns an additional key called `display_price`, which is the proper rendering of the price of a product.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- The Images API's `attachment_url` key has been removed in favour of keys that reflect the current image styles available in the application, such as `mini_url` and `product_url`. Use these now to references images.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Fix issue where calling OrdersController#update with line item parameters would _always_ create new line items, rather than updating existing ones.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- The Orders API endpoint now returns an additional key called `display_item_total`, which is the proper rendering of the total line item price of an order.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Include a `per_page` key in Products API end response so that libraries like jQuery.simplePagination can use this to display a pagination element on the page.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Line item responses now contain `single_display_amount` and `display_amount` for "pretty" versions of the single and total amount for a line item, as well as a `total` node which is an "ugly" version of the total amount of a line item.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- /api/orders endpoints now accept a `?order_token` parameter which should be the order's token. This can be used to authorize actions on an order without having to pass in an API key.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Requests to POST /api/line_items will now update existing line items. For example if you have a line item with a variant ID=2 and quantity=10 and you attempt to create a new line item for the same variant with a quantity of 5, the existing line item's quantity will be updated to 15. Previously, a new line item would erroneously be created.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- /api/countries now will a 304 response if no country has been changed since the last request.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- The Shipments API no longer returns inventory units. Instead, it will return manifest objects. This is necessary due to the split shipments changes brought in by Spree 2.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Checkouts API's update action will now correctly process line item attributes (either `line_items` or `line_item_attributes`)

  _Ryan Bigg_

- The structure of shipments data in the API has changed. Shipments can now have many shipping methods, shipping rates (which in turn have many zones and shipping categories), as well as a new key called "manifest" which returns the list of items contained within just this shipment for the order.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Address responses now contain a `full_name` attribute.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Shipments responses now contain a `selected_shipping_rate` key, so that you don't have to sort through the list of `shipping_rates` to get the selected one.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Checkouts API now correctly processes incoming payment data during the payment step.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Fix issue where `set_current_order` before filter would be called when CheckoutsController actions were run, causing the order object to be deleted. #3306

  _Ryan Bigg_

- An order can no longer transition past the "cart" state without first having a line item. #3312

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Attributes other than "quantity" and "variant_id" will be added to a line item when creating along with an order. #3404

  _Alex Marles & Ryan Bigg_

- Requests to POST /api/line_items will now update existing line items. For example if you have a line item with a variant ID=2 and quantity=10 and you attempt to create a new line item for the same variant with a quantity of 5, the existing line item's quantity will be updated to 15. Previously, a new line item would erroneously be created.

  - Ryan Bigg

- Checkouts API's update action will now correctly process line item attributes (either `line_items` or `line_item_attributes`)

  - Ryan Bigg

- Taxon attributes from `/api/taxons` are now returned within `taxons` subkey. Before:

```json
[{ name: 'Ruby' ... }]
```

Now:

```json
{ "taxons": [{ "name": "Ruby" }] }
```

## Backend

- layouts/admin.html.erb was broken into partials for each section. e.g.
  header, menu, submenu, sidebar. Extensions should update their deface
  overrides accordingly

  _Washington Luiz_

- No longer requires all jquery ui modules. Extensions should include the
  ones they need on their own manifest file. #3237

  _Washington Luiz_

- Symbolize attachment style keys on ImageSettingController otherwise users
  would get _undefined method `processors' for "48x48>":String>_ since
  paperclip can't handle key strings. #3069 #3080

  _Washington Luiz_

- Split line items across shipments. Use this to move line items between
  existing shipments or to create a new shipment on an order from existing
  line items.

  _John Dyer_

- Fixed display of "Total" price for a line item on a shipment. #3135

  _John Dyer_

- Fixed issue where selecting an existing user in the customer details step would not associate them with an order.

  _Ryan Bigg and dan-ding_

- We now use [jQuery.payment](https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment) (from Stripe) to provide slightly better formatting on credit card number, expiry and CVV fields.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- "Infinite scrolling" now implemented for products taxon search to prevent loading all taxons at once. Only 50 taxons are loaded at a time now.

  _Ryan Bigg_

## Cmd

No changes.

## Core

- Product requires `shipping_category_id` on create #3188.

  _Jeff Dutil_

- No longer set ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = true during install.
  Originally set to false back in 2011 according to convention. After
  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spree-user/D9dZQayC4z, it
  was changed. Applications should now decide their own setting for this value.

  _Weston Platter_

- Change `order.promotion_credit_exists?` api. Now it receives an adjustment
  originator (PromotionAction instance) instead of a promotion. Allowing
  multiple adjustments being created for the same promotion as the current
  PromotionAction / Promotion api suggests #3262

- Remove after_save callback for stock items backorders processing and
  fixes count on hand updates when there are backordered units #3066

  _Washington Luiz_

- InventoryUnit#backordered_for_stock_item no longer returns readonly objects
  neither return an ActiveRecored::Association. It returns only an array of
  writable backordered units for a given stock item #3066

  _Washington Luiz_

- Scope shipping rates as per shipping method display_on #3119
  e.g. Shipping methods set to back_end only should not be displayed on frontend too

  _Washington Luiz_

- Add `propagate_all_variants` attribute to StockLocation. It controls
  whether a stock items should be created fot the stock location every time
  a variant or a stock location is created

  _Washington Luiz_

- Add `backorderable_default` attribute to StockLocation. It sets the
  backorderable attribute of each new stock item

  _Washington Luiz_

- Removed `t()` override in `Spree::BaseHelper`. #3083

  _Washington Luiz_

- Improve performance of `Order#payment_required?` by not updating the totals every time. #3040 #3086

  _Washington Luiz_

- Fixed the FlexiRate Calculator for cases when max_items is set. #3159

  _Dana Jones_

- Translation for admin tabs are now located under the `spree.admin.tab` key. Previously, they were on the top-level, which led to conflicts when users wanted to override view translations, like this:

```yaml
en:
  spree:
    orders:
      show:
        thank_you: 'Thanks, buddy!'
```

See #3133 for more information.

    * Ryan Bigg*

- CreditCard model now validates that the card is not expired.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Payment model will now no longer provide a vague error message for when the source is invalid. Instead, it will provide error messages like "Credit Card Number can't be blank"

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Calling #destroy on any PaymentMethod, Product, TaxCategory, TaxRate or Variant object will now no longer delete that object. Instead, the `deleted_at` attribute on that object will be set to the current time. Attempting to find that object again using something such as `Spree::Product.find(1)` will fail because there is now a default scope to only find _non_-deleted records on these models. To remove this scope, use `Spree::Product.unscoped.find(1)`. #3321

  _Ryan Bigg_

- Removed `variants_including_master_and_deleted`, in favour of using the Paranoia gem. This scope would now be achieved using `variants_including_master.with_deleted`.

  _Ryan Bigg_

- You can now find the total amount on hand of a variant by calling `Variant#total_on_hand`. #3427

  _Ruben Ascencio_

- Tax categories are now stored on line items. This should make tax calculations slightly faster. #3481

  _Ryan Bigg_

- `update_attribute(s)_without_callbacks` have gone away, in favour of `update_column(s)`

  _Ryan Bigg_

## Frontend

- Fix issue where "Use Billing Address" checkbox was unticked when certain
  browsers autocompleted the checkout form. #3068 #3085

  _Washington Luiz_

- Switch to new Google Analytics analytics.js SDK from ga.js SDK for custom dimensions & metrics.

  _Jeff Dutil_

- We now use [jQuery.payment](https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment) (from Stripe) to provide slightly better formatting on credit card number, expiry and CVV fields.

  _Ryan Bigg_

## Spree::ActiveShipping

- Origin address fields (e.g., origin_country) have been removed from the Spree::ActiveShipping preferences.
