## Major/New Features

3.5 is a smaller release to lay the groundwork for major new features
described in [Spree Development Roadmap](https://github.com/spree/spree/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).
It also contains number of bug fixes and improvements besides described in this document.

### Multi-store management

We've added an ability to manage multiple stores in one Spree instance of your application.
Thanks to that you can easily create stores per region / language / currency.
This feature will be enhanced in the next releases.

### Extracted Analytics tracker into an Extension

Our goal is always to keep the core Spree lean and flexible that's why we've moved all of the code of
Analytics Trackers to an Extension which you can use with any `Spree 3.1+` version.

[Spree Analytics Trackers](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers) extension currently supports Google Analytics and Segment.com.

### Admin Panel views exporter

You can easily copy all of the default spree admin Panel into
your project with just one command line:

```bash
rails g spree:backend:copy_views
```

We hope will make backend customization the Admin Panel a lot easier.
