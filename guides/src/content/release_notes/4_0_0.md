## Major/New Features

**Spree 4.0** requires **Rails 6.0.0** and **Ruby 2.5.0** (or higher).

### Rails 6.0 support

### Storefront and Admin Panel moved upgraded to Bootstrap 4.2

We've migrated both the default Spree frontend and Admin Panel from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4.2. This update brings all of the new features and fixes introduced in [Bootstrap 4](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/), [4.1](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/04/09/bootstrap-4-1/) and [4.2](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/12/21/bootstrap-4-2-1/). Accessibility and RWD was also improved in the process.

Besides the Spree Frontend and Admin Panel we've also upgraded all extensions that required fixes, that is:

- [Auth Devise](https://github.com/spree/spree_auth_devise)
