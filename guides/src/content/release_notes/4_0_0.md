## Major/New Features

### Rails 6.0 support

Spree 4.0 is fully compatible with [Rails 6.0](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/6_0_release_notes.html)
and the new default [Zeitwerk code autoloader](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2019/2/22/zeitwerk-integration-in-rails-6-beta-2/).

### Storefront and Admin Panel moved to Bootstrap 4.2

We've migrated both the default Spree frontend and Admin Panel from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4.2. This update brings all of the new features and fixes introduced in [Bootstrap 4](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/), [4.1](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/04/09/bootstrap-4-1/) and [4.2](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/12/21/bootstrap-4-2-1/). Accessibility and RWD were also improved in the process.

Besides the Spree Frontend and Admin Panel we've also upgraded all extensions that required fixes, that is:

- [Auth Devise](https://github.com/spree/spree_auth_devise)
- [I18n](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n)
- [Multi Currency](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_multi_currency)
- [Analytics Trackers](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers)
- [Digital](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_digital)
- [Social](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_social)
- [Editor](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_editor)
- [Recently Viewed](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_recently_viewed)
- [Related Products](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_related_products)
- [Static Content](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_static_content)
- [Email to friend](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_email_to_friend)
- [Volume Pricing](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_volume_pricing)
- [Braintree vzero](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero)
- [Product Assembly](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree-product-assembly)
- [Avatax Certified](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_avatax_official)

If you use any of those extensions please update them along with the Spree update.

### Address Book support

Previously for multiple addresses support you had to use the [Spree Address Book](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_address_book) extension. We've decided that this was an inconsistency (user account already supported multiple credit cards) and moved this code into the core Spree and improved it.

Thanks to this signed in customers can manage multiple addresses in the Checkout and Account for both Shipping and Billing.

### JSON-LD strctured data support

To support schema.org we've replaced the old Microdata code with the new recommended JSON-LD format. This will make your store more future proof and improve SEO in the coming months.

## Installation

### Add Spree gems to Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 4.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 4.0'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.6'
