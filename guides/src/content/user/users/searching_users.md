title: Searching Users
---

When you click the **Users** tab you will see a **Filter dropdown**, a **New User** button, and all existing users that have ever created an account on your page.

Next to each user's email, there are 2 buttons and by clicking User above the list of users’ emails, you can sort them by name.

* **Edit** - Allows you to make [additional changes to the user's settings](/user/users/editing_users.html).
* **Delete** - Allows you to [delete the user permanently](/user/users/deleting_users.html).
* **Sort by user's name** - Allows you to sort the users by name (A-Z, Z-A).

## Filtering Users

You may not always want to see all of the users, as is the Spree default. You may want to view only those users to which you want to make additional changes. The default way of sorting the users that are present is by the name.

You can choose one or more of the following options to narrow your user search, then click the **Filter** button to extend filter options in the dropdown.
