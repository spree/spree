## New Menu Options

Once you have entered the New Menu screen, you are presented with four options.

* **Name:** You must give your menu a name; the menu name is not displayed in the frontend store view, so feel free to name your menu something you can quickly identify.

* **Store:** Each menu belongs to one store; set the store that you want this menu to appear in.

* **Location:** Choose the location of your menu. By default, you are offered the choice of Header or Footer; if you wish to add more options, click here to view the developer docs.

* **Locale:** Each Menu is unique by **Store**, **Location** and **Language**; for example, you can not have two menus for your **Default Store**, that both appear in the **Header**, and
both use the language **English**.

Once you have familiarized yourself with the options above, populate each field as required and click **Create**.

Upon creating your first menu, you will be presented with a Menu Items Area; this is where you organize the links of your menu.
