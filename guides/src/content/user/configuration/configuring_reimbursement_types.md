## Introduction

To make it easier for you when you need to make a reimbursement, there are various reimbursement types that help you define what kind of return to give to the customer (e.g store credit, credit card or exchange for a new item).

## Creating a Reimbursement Type

You simply open the **Configuration** tab and press **Reimbursement Types**.
Now, you can see all previously set up types, with the possibility to add a new one.

The type is created via backend work and we're at your service to make it easy. This option defines what kind of return to give to the user, such as a credit card refund or an exchange for a new item.
