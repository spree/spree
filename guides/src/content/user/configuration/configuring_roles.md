## Introduction

Roles are used to define user’s permissions on your website. This option gives you the ability to control users rights. By default Spree offers two kinds of Roles - **Admin** and **User**. If you would like to make more roles with specific features than Admin and User role, our company offers making those by backend work.
You can extend Roles with additional development for specific features other than Admin and User roles. To open the **Roles** tab extend **Configuration** dropdown and find **Roles**.

## Creating new Role
