## Introduction

Roles are used to define users' permissions on your website. This option gives you the ability to control the rights of users. By default, Spree offers two kinds of Roles: **Admin** and **User**. If you would like to create other roles with more specific features than the Admin and User roles, our company offers creating them for you, with the help of a little backend development work.
To open the **Roles** tab, extend the **Configuration** dropdown and find **Roles**.

## Creating a New Role

To create a new role, click the **New Role** button that is placed in the upper right corner of the page.
