## Introduction

Understanding your site's visitor traffic patterns is very important when it comes to planning your company's marketing and growth strategies.

### Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce and Segment Ecommerce

In order to enable Spree Analytics Tracker, the following extension is required, which we have extracted from the Spree core: https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers.

Spree's Admin Interface makes it easy for you to add the robust Google Analytics and Segment toolset to your site.

Both Google Analytics and Segment provide detailed information about your site. Spree allows you to integrate both in order to show detailed live events; for example, you can see on which step of the checkout process the user stopped or how long it took to complete the checkout.

Segment.com also allows you to plug-in a lot of additional vendors and services like:

* Mixpanel
* Kissmetrics
* Google Tag Manager
* Facebook Pixels
* Google Adwords remarketing
* [and hundreds others](https://segment.com/catalog/#integrations/all)

This integration gives you control without requiring any further help from the developer's side.
You can then plan your marketing strategy and track the results it without interrupting the work of your developers. Isn't that great?
