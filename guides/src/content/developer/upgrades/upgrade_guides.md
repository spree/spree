## Upgrade Guides

We strongly advise upgrading Spree incrementally, rather than in one big go. For example, if you're upgrading a Spree store from 0.60.x to 2.4.x, you would read through all of these guides, one by one.

If there are any issues with these guides, please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/new).
