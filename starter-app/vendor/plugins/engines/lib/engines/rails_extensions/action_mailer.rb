# The way ActionMailer is coded in terms of finding templates is very restrictive, to the point
# where all templates for rendering must exist under the single base path. This is difficult to
# work around without re-coding significant parts of the action mailer code.
#

#
# The MailTemplates module overrides two (private) methods from ActionMailer to enable mail 
# templates within plugins:
#
# [+template_path+]             which now produces the contents of #template_paths
# [+initialize_template_class+] which now find the first matching template and creates 
#                               an ActionVew::Base instance with the correct view_paths
#
# Ideally ActionMailer would use the same template-location logic as ActionView, and the same
# view paths as ActionController::Base.view_paths, but it currently does not.

    # ActionMailer::Base#create uses two mechanisms to determine the proper template file(s)
    # to load. Firstly, it searches within the template_root for files that much the explicit
    # (or implicit) part encodings (like signup.text.plain.erb for the signup action). 
    # This is how implicit multipart emails are built, by the way.
    #
    # Secondly, it then creates an ActionMailer::Base instance with it's view_paths parameter
    # set to the template_root, so that ActionMailer will then take over rendering the
    # templates.
    #
    # Ideally, ActionMailer would pass the same set of view paths as it gets in a normal
    # request (i.e. ActionController::Base.view_paths), so that all possible view paths
    # were searched. However, this seems to introduce some problems with helper modules.
    #
    # So instead, and because we have to fool these two independent parts of ActionMailer,
    # we fudge with the mechanisms it uses to find the templates (via template_paths, and
    # template_path_with_engine_additions), and then intercept the creation of the ActionView
    # instance so we can set the view_paths (in initialize_template_class_with_engine_additions).
