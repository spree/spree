// This controller is needed if you have many forms that are using turbo and can be submitted in rapid succession.
// Turbo by default will cancel all the previous requests and only submit the last one,
// but server side you will still receive all the requests and process them.
// And since the request was cancelled, turbo will not process the response.
// So this may lead to desync between the UI and the server.
// GH issue: https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/issues/310
// Code that causes issue: https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/blob/main/src/core/drive/navigator.js#L32
