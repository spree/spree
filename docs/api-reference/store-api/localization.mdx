The Store API supports multi-language, multi-currency, and market-aware responses. Use request headers to control the locale, currency, and country for each request.

## Headers

| Header | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `X-Spree-Locale` | `fr` | Language for translated content (product names, descriptions, etc.) |
| `X-Spree-Currency` | `EUR` | Currency for prices and totals |
| `X-Spree-Country` | `FR` | Country ISO code for market resolution |

## Setting Locale and Currency

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// Set locale and currency per request
const products = await client.store.products.list({}, {
  locale: 'fr',
  currency: 'EUR',
  country: 'FR',
})

// Works on any endpoint
const product = await client.store.products.get('spree-tote', {
  includes: 'variants',
}, {
  locale: 'de',
  currency: 'EUR',
})
```

```bash cURL
curl -G 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/products' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Locale: fr' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Currency: EUR'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Country and Markets

The `X-Spree-Country` header resolves the customer's [market](/developer/core-concepts/markets), which influences default locale and currency. Markets allow you to configure different pricing, languages, and product availability per region.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// Setting country automatically resolves the market
const products = await client.store.products.list({}, {
  country: 'DE', // Resolves German market
})
```

```bash cURL
curl -G 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/products' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Country: DE'
```

</CodeGroup>

When a market is resolved from the country:
1. The market's default locale is used (unless overridden by `X-Spree-Locale`)
2. The market's default currency is used (unless overridden by `X-Spree-Currency`)

## Resolution Priority

Each value is resolved in the following order:

### Locale
1. `X-Spree-Locale` header
2. `locale` query parameter
3. Market default locale (if country is set)
4. Store default locale

### Currency
1. `X-Spree-Currency` header
2. `currency` query parameter
3. Market default currency (if country is set)
4. Store default currency

### Market
1. `X-Spree-Country` header
2. `country` query parameter

<Note>
The locale and currency must be supported by the current store. If an unsupported value is provided, the API falls back to the store's default.
</Note>

## Translated Content

When a locale is set, all translatable fields are returned in the requested language. This includes product names, descriptions, taxon names, and other content managed through [translations](/developer/core-concepts/translations).

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// English (default)
const enProduct = await client.store.products.get('spree-tote')
console.log(enProduct.name) // "Spree Tote"

// French
const frProduct = await client.store.products.get('spree-tote', {}, {
  locale: 'fr',
})
console.log(frProduct.name) // "Sac Spree"
```

```bash cURL
# English
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/products/spree-tote' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Locale: en'

# French
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/products/spree-tote' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Locale: fr'
```

</CodeGroup>

If a translation doesn't exist for the requested locale, the API falls back to the store's default locale automatically.

## Currency-Aware Prices

All price fields in the response reflect the requested currency:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// USD prices
const usdProduct = await client.store.products.get('spree-tote', {}, {
  currency: 'USD',
})
console.log(usdProduct.price) // { amount: "15.99", currency: "USD" }

// EUR prices
const eurProduct = await client.store.products.get('spree-tote', {}, {
  currency: 'EUR',
})
console.log(eurProduct.price) // { amount: "14.49", currency: "EUR" }
```

```bash cURL
# USD prices
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/products/spree-tote' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Currency: USD'

# EUR prices
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/products/spree-tote' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Currency: EUR'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Available Locales and Currencies

To discover which locales and currencies a store supports, fetch the store information:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
const store = await client.store.store.get()
console.log(store.supported_locales)    // ["en", "fr", "de"]
console.log(store.supported_currencies) // ["USD", "EUR", "GBP"]
console.log(store.default_locale)       // "en"
console.log(store.default_currency)     // "USD"
```

```bash cURL
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store/store' \
  -H 'X-Spree-Api-Key: spree_pk_xxx'
```
