This API reference includes Spree Store APIs, which are REST APIs exposed by the Spree application. They are used to create a storefront for your commerce store, such as a website, point of sale or a commerce mobile app.

All API Routes are prefixed with `/api/v3/store`. So, during development, the API Routes will be available under the path `http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store`. For production, replace `http://localhost:3000` with your Spree application URL.

## Using SDK

We recommend using the Spree SDK to interact with the Store API. The SDK provides a convenient way to make API requests and handle responses.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @spree/sdk
# or
yarn add @spree/sdk
# or
pnpm add @spree/sdk
```

### Quick Start

```typescript
import { createSpreeClient } from '@spree/sdk';

// Initialize the client
const client = createSpreeClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
  publishableKey: 'spree_pk_xxx'
});
```
