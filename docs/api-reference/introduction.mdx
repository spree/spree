This API reference includes Spree Store APIs, which are REST APIs exposed by the Spree application. They are used to create a storefront for your commerce store, such as a webshop or a commerce mobile app.

All API Routes are prefixed with `/api/v3/store`. So, during development, the API Routes will be available under the path `http://localhost:3000/api/v3/store`. For production, replace `http://localhost:3000` with your Spree application URL.
