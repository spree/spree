Spree Commerce open-source comes with a fully-featured Ecommerce API enabling a fully headless mode. This means that you can use Spree as a backend to build your custom [Next.js storefront](https://spreecommerce.org/category/next-js-ecommerce/), eCommerce mobile app functionality, or any other customer-facing application that needs to interact with an e-commerce platform.

## API v2

Currently Spree includes 2 modern REST APIs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Storefront API" href="storefront">
    Designed to allow customers to interact with the store via external applications (e.g. Next.js storefront or a dedicated mobile app)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Platform API" href="platform">
    Provides management capabilities, allowing third party apps to perform actions otherwise available via the admin panel.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Legacy REST API v1

Legacy REST API v1 was extracted to `spree_api_v1` gem. It is not recommended to use it in new projects, but it's still available for existing ones.
