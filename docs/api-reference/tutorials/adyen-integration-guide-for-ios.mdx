title: Adyen Integration Guide for iOS
description: This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating Adyen iOS Drop-in with spree_adyen using session flow and Drop-In component.
---

<Warning>
This guide is aimed at advanced users who want to create adyen integration for their custom iOS application.
You also need to install Spree Adyen extension before.
</Warning>

## Requirements

- Adyen test account
- Set up `spree_adyen` spree extension

### return_url

spree_adyen needs to be configured with `return_url`.

Return url tells where shopper should be redirect after the payment from outside your application (for example klarna or most of others buy now pay later systems).

Use the custom URL for your app, like `my-app://adyen`. Url can contain custom query params however do not include any personally identifiable information (PII) of your customer. Maximum length of the url is 1024 characters.

## Note

The list of available library versions can be found on [Official Adyen Documentation for iOS integration](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/sessions-flow/?platform=iOS&integration=Drop-in&version=5.13.1)
Current newest version available at the moment of writing the tutorial is 5.19.2.

## Overview

The integration consists of two main components:

- **Spree Adyen**: Provides API for your client and receive payment result from Adyen
- **Your iOS client app**: Shows the Drop-in UI and handles payment flow

## Step 1: Install adyen with Swift Package Manager

repository URL:
```
https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-ios
```
use at least version 5.0.0

CocoaPods and Carthage instructions are available [here](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/sessions-flow/?platform=iOS&integration=Drop-in&version=5.19.2&tab=cocoapods_1_2#1-get-adyen-ios).

## Step 2: Create the context

Create the instance of APIContext that includes client key and environment setting.

```swift
// Set the client key and environment in an instance of APIContext.
let apiContext = APIContext(clientKey: clientKey, environment: Environment.test) // Set the environment to a live one when going live.
// Create the amount with the value in minor units and the currency code.
let amount = Amount(value: 1000, currencyCode: "EUR")
// Create the payment object with the amount and country code.
let payment = Payment(amount: amount, countryCode: "NL")
// Create an instance of AdyenContext, passing the instance of APIContext, and payment object.
let adyenContext = AdyenContext(apiContext: apiContext, payment:payment)
```

`environment` - Environment.test or Environment.live
`clientKey` - `client_key` from payment_sessions endpoint

## Step 3: Create and set up session

Create a session using [payment_session endpoint](/api-reference/storefront/adyen/create-an-adyen-payment-session).
Then set a configuration using data from the response:

```swift
let configuration = AdyenSession.Configuration(sessionIdentifier: sessionId,
			  																				initialSessionData: data)
```

- `data` - available as `adyen_data` in payment_session API response
- `sessionId` - available as `adyen_id` in payment_session API response

With the configuration you initialize AdyenSession:

```swift
AdyenSession.initialize(with: configuration, delegate: self, presentationDelegate: self) { [weak self] result in
				switch result {
				case let .success(session):
						//Store the session object.
						self?.session = session
				case let .failure(error):
						//Handle the error.
				}
		}
```

## Step 4. Configure Drop-in

```swift
let dropInConfiguration = DropInComponent.Configuration()
// Some payment methods have additional required or optional configuration.
// For example, an optional configuration to show the cardholder name field for cards.
dropInConfiguration.card.showsHolderNameField = true
```

## Step 5: Initialize the DropInComponent class

```swift
let dropInComponent = DropInComponent(paymentMethods: session.sessionContext.paymentMethods,
																			context: adyenContext,
																			configuration: dropInConfiguration)
	
// Keep the instance of Drop-in to so that it doesn't get destroyed after the function is executed.
self.dropInComponent = dropInComponent
	
// Set the session as the delegate.
dropInComponent.delegate = session
// If you support gift cards, set the session as the partial payment delegate.
dropInComponent.partialPaymentDelegate = session
```

## Step 6: Show Drop-in in your app

```swift
myCheckoutViewController.present(dropInComponent.viewController, animated: true)
```

If the `action` field is `redirect` you need to handle the redirect result.

## Step 7. Handling the redirect result

If the `action` field returns `redirect` the shopper is completing the payment outside of your application. You need to inform the Drop-in when the shopper returns to your app.

Here an example for a Custom Url scheme:
- implement the following in your `UIApplicationDelegate`:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
		return RedirectComponent.applicationDidOpen(from: url)
}
```

for Universal URL use this instead:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
		guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
						let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL else { return false }
		return RedirectComponent.applicationDidOpen(from: incomingURL)
}
```

## Step 8: Show the shopper result of the payment

When the payment flow is finished, your instance of AdyenSession calls the didComplete method.
Implement the following in your Drop-in configuration object.

```swift
func didComplete(with result: AdyenSessionResult, // The session result.
									component: Component, // The Drop-in component.
									session: AdyenSession) // Your instance of AdyenSession.
```

Use the resultCode to inform your shopper about the current payment status.
Possible resultCode values:
- `authorised` - payment authorised
- `refused` - payment refused
- `pending` - payment pending (for payments with asynchronous flow like iDEAL). When the shopper completes the payment webhook will process process the payment.
- `cancelled` - payment canceled
- `received` - some payments needs more time to be processed. When the status is available webhook will process the payment
- `error` - an error occured when processing the payment. The response contains more details with the error code
  Your instance of AdyenSession calls the didFail method containing the error.
	```swift
	func didFail(with error: Error, // The error object.
	             from component: Component, // The Drop-in component.
	             session: AdyenSession) // Your instance of AdyenSession.
	```

## Step 8: Continue shopping experience

1. Wait for backend to process the payment
2. Continue shopping experience

### 1. Wait for backend to process the payment

backend after receiving webhook will change the state of `payment_session` to one of the following state:
- `pending` - chosen payment method can take a while to complete
- `completed` - payment resulted in success, order completed
- `canceled` - payment canceled, payment is `void`
- `refused` - payment failed

### 2. Continue shopping experience

if succeed - order is processed and completed

if failed - payment can be retried using new payment session
