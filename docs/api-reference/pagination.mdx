All lists implement the same method for pagination with `page` and `per_page` parameters, eg.

```curl
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://demo.spreecommerce.org/api/v2/storefront/products?page=1&per_page=25' \
     --header 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json'
```

Both of these parameters are optional. There is a limit of 500 records that can be fetched by a single request. If this doesn't work for your use case, please contact us so we can work on resolving this issue.

Response for that call will include a `meta` node with:

```json
"meta": {
  "count": 25,
  "total_count": 26,
  "total_pages": 2
}
```

`count` is the number of records returned on the current page  
`total_count` is the total number of records in the collection  
`total_pages` is the total number of pages

The response will also include the`links` node:

```json
"links": {
    "self": "https://demo.spreecommerce.org/api/v2/storefront/products?per_page=25",
    "next": "https://demo.spreecommerce.org/api/v2/storefront/products?page=2&per_page=25",
    "prev": "https://demo.spreecommerce.org/api/v2/storefront/products?page=1&per_page=25",
    "last": "https://demo.spreecommerce.org/api/v2/storefront/products?page=2&per_page=25",
    "first": "https://demo.spreecommerce.org/api/v2/storefront/products?page=1&per_page=25"
  }
```

With fully generates API URLs for pagination.
