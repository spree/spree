Gift cards allow customers (or recipients) to redeem a prepaid balance at checkout. In Spree, you can create single gift cards for specific customers or generate batches of codes for broader distribution.

To get started, navigate to **Promotions → Gift Cards** in the admin dashboard.

Click **New Gift Card** in the top right corner.

You’ll be prompted to choose between:

- **Gift Card** (single code)
- **Gift Card Batch** (multiple codes generated at once)

## Create a Single Gift Card

Selecting **Gift Card** opens the creation form.

Complete the following fields:

- **Email (optional)** - Assign the gift card to a specific customer email, or leave blank to create an unassigned code.
- **Code** - Leave blank to auto-generate a unique code, or enter one manually.
- **Amount** (required) - The value of the gift card.
- **Currency** (required) - The currency the card should be issued in.
- **Expires At** - Optional expiration date. Leave blank for a non-expiring card.

Click **Create** to issue the gift card. It will appear in the Gift Cards table and can be redeemed using the code at checkout.

## Create a Gift Card Batch (Bulk Generation)

Selecting **Gift Card Batch** allows you to generate multiple codes at once.

The form includes the same core fields as a single gift card (excluding the Customer field), plus:

- **Prefix** - Adds a custom prefix to each generated code (e.g., HOLIDAY-, VIP-).
- **Codes Count** (required) - The total number of gift card codes to generate.

Spree will automatically create the specified number of unique codes.

After clicking **Create**, all generated gift cards will be added to the Gift Cards table.

## Manage & Export Gift Cards

Once created, gift cards appear in the main table view under **Promotions → Gift Cards**.

The table displays key information for each card, including:

- Code
- Original amount
- Amount of credit used
- Currency
- Expiration date
- Assigned customer (if any)

This makes it easy to monitor usage and track remaining balances.
