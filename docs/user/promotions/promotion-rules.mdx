Promotion rules define the conditions that must be met for a promotion to be applied. Spree gives you full control over when a promotion should be eligible - whether it’s based on the order total, customer group, specific products, or a user’s login status.

Each promotion can have multiple rules, and you can choose whether all rules must match (match all) or any rule must match (match any).

## Rule Match Policies

At the top of the Rules section in the promotion editor, you’ll see the Match Policy toggle:

- **Match all** - All rules must be satisfied for the promotion to apply.
- **Match any** - Only one rule needs to be satisfied.

This gives you flexibility to fine-tune how strict or lenient the promotion conditions should be.

## Available Promotion Rules

Below is a list of all rule types currently supported in Spree, along with when and why you might use them.

### Item Total

Applies the promotion only if the order total meets a specific threshold.

Use this when:

- Offering discounts above a certain spend (e.g. \$50+ orders)
- Creating tiered incentives for larger carts

### Country

Limits the promotion to customers whose shipping address is in a specific country.

Useful for:

- International promotions
- Localized campaigns (e.g., “Free shipping in the US”)

### Currency

Applies the promotion only to orders in a specific currency.

Use this if:

- You're running different promotions in different markets
- You want to avoid coupon misuse across regional stores

### Product(s)

Limits the promotion to orders that include one or more specific products (variants).

Perfect for:

- Targeted discounts on select SKUs
- Bundling or cross-sell offers

### Taxon(s)

Applies when the order includes products belonging to specific taxons (categories, collections, etc.).

Ideal for:

- Category-wide promotions (e.g., “25% off all shoes”)
- Seasonal or campaign-specific collections

### Option Value(s)

Triggers when products in the cart have a specific option value (e.g., color, size, material).

Use cases:

- Color-specific clearance sales
- Size-limited inventory promos

### User

Applies only to specific customers.

This is useful for:

- VIP offers
- Manually targeting customers (e.g. after support tickets, outreach)

### First Order

Applies only if the promotion is being used on a customer’s first-ever order.

Great for:

- Welcome offers
- Signup conversion boosts

### User Logged In

Applies only when the customer is logged in.

Use this to:

- Encourage account creation
- Hide promotions from guest checkout users

### One Use Per User

Restricts the promotion so that each user can only use it once.

Helps prevent abuse and maintain exclusivity.

### Customer Group

Limits the promotion to customers belonging to a specific Customer Group.

Perfect for:

- Wholesale or B2B-only promotions
- Segment-specific campaigns (e.g., “Early Access” or “Loyal Customers”)

Customer Groups are created under [<u>Customers → Customer Groups</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/customers/customer-groups).
