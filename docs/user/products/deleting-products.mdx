There may be times when you need to permanently remove a product from your catalog - for example, if it was added by mistake, duplicated, or no longer needed in your system.

Deleting a product removes it entirely from your store and the admin interface. However, this action is <u>not available</u> for products associated with any orders, whether completed or not.

<Note>
  If a product is linked to one or more orders, it cannot be deleted. In these cases, set the productâ€™s **Status** to **Archived** instead. This removes it from the storefront while keeping it in the admin, making it clear to other team members that the product is discontinued or no longer active.
