If you need to create multiple products with similar details - such as color variants, seasonal versions, or items with the same structure - cloning an existing product can save you a lot of time. This is especially helpful when working with multi-variant products.

## How to Clone a Product

1. Go to the **Products** tab in the admin and open the product you want to clone.
2. Click the **three-dot menu** in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Clone** from the dropdown.

Youâ€™ll be redirected to the product editor for the newly cloned product.

### Cloning Behaviour

When cloning a product, most of the product fields are copied over, with a few key differences:

- **Name** changes to **COPY OF Name**
- **Slug** changes to **/copy-of-name**
- **Status** is set to **Draft** by default
- **Stock** quantity is reset to **0**

## Update the New Product

Now that the product has been cloned, you'll need to update the product details as needed (e.g., name, media, price, stock levels) to reflect the new product.

Remember to click **Update** at the top or bottom of the page to save your changes.
