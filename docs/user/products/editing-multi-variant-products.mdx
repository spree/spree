Editing multi-variant products is a bit more involved than single-variant ones, since each variant can have unique details - such as pricing, stock levels, or media.

This guide will show you how to manage variant options, edit individual variants, and tailor settings for specific combinations.

## How to Edit a Multi-Variant Product

To get started, go to the **Products** tab in the admin dashboard, and click on the product you'd like to update to open the product editor.

Scroll down to the **Variants** section where you should see all associated product variants.

This section is where you can manage all settings related to the product’s variants, including options, pricing, inventory, and more.

## Options

![](/docs/images/user/products/multi-variant-products/3.options.png)

At the top of the **Variants** section, you’ll see the product's assigned **Options** (e.g., Color and Size) along with their respective values (e.g., White, Blue, S, M, etc.).

### Edit Options

- To edit an Option, click the **Edit** button. You can:
  - Add or remove values (e.g., remove “XS” or add “L”)
  - Change the Option Name by selecting a new one from the dropdown
- To add another Option entirely, click **\+ Add another option** at the bottom.

Click **Done** to save your changes.

<Note>
  Changes here will automatically update the list of generated variants below.

## List of Variants

Beneath the **Options** editor, you’ll see a list of product variants generated by the Option Value combinations.

For example, 2 colors × 3 sizes = 6 total variants.

Each variant row includes fields for:

- **Price**
- **Quantity**
- **Edit** button (for advanced settings)

You can adjust price and stock directly in this view by entering new values into the respective fields.

## Editing Variants

In some cases, variants may differ significantly, whether it be by size, weight, barcode, or even media. For these situations, it’s helpful to manage them individually.

To edit a variant, click **Edit** to open the **variant editor**.

<Warning>
  If you’ve made changes to the main product, be sure to click **Update** before editing a variant. Otherwise, those changes may be lost when switching views.

Here you can modify the following fields:

- **SKU**
- **Barcode**
- **Tax Category**
- **Discontinue On**
- **Dimensions**
- **Weight**
- **Price**
- **Compare At Amount**
- **Quantity**
- **Backorderable**
- **Media**

Remember to click **Update** to save any changes you've made.

## Variant-Specific Media

You can upload images specific to each variant to improve the product detail page experience.

For example, if you sell a shirt that's available in White and Blue, upload white-shirt images to the White variants and blue-shirt images to the Blue variants.

This ensures that when a customer selects a variant on the storefront, the most relevant images are shown automatically.

## Deleting Variants

![](/docs/images/user/products/multi-variant-products/8.delete_variants.png)

Since not all combinations of color, size, etc., may be valid for sale, you may wish to delete some variants entirely.

If there are variants you don’t offer:

1. Check the box next to the unwanted variant(s)
2. Click **Delete selected**

Deleting a variant will remove it's row from the list. To undo this, reconfigure the **Options** and then click **Update** at the top/bottom of the page.

## Save Changes

Whether you're editing the main product or a variant, always remember to click **Update** to save your changes.
