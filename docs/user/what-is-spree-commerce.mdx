## About Spree Commerce

[Spree Commerce](https://spreecommerce.org/) is an API-first, [open-source eCommerce platform](https://github.com/spree/spree) built for fast growing businesses and enterprises.

Spree allows you to build [B2B eCommerce](https://spreecommerce.org/use-cases/headless-b2b-ecommerce/), [multi-store](https://spreecommerce.org/multi-store-ecommerce/), [multi-region](https://spreecommerce.org/multi-region-ecommerce/), [multi-vendor marketplace](https://spreecommerce.org/marketplace-ecommerce/), and [multi-tenant commerce](https://spreecommerce.org/multi-tenant-white-label-ecommerce/) - and you can combine them to match your exact business model. 

If SaaS solutions don't give you the control and flexibility your business needs, Spree is the answer.

Spree is trusted by thousands of businesses around the world, including GoDaddy, Huckberry, Craftsman, DieHard, Kenmore, Paccar, Maisonette, Goop, Garmentory, and Blue Bottle Coffee.

Spree comes in two flavors - as a free Community Edition or as a paid Enterprise Edition.

## Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Community Edition" href="https://github.com/spree/spree/">
    Spree Community Edition is free. It's the DIY version of Spree. It comes with community support only.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enterprise Edition" href="https://spreecommerce.org/enterprise/">
    Spree Enterprise Edition comes with more features, more security, more integrations and enterprise support.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

TL;DR The Community Edition gives you freedom. The Enterprise Edition saves you time.

So what sets both versions apart? Here's a [feature comparison](https://spreecommerce.org/enterprise/) of the two editions and here's an [in-depth overview](https://spreecommerce.org/spree-commerce-version-comparison-community-edition-vs-enterprise-edition/).

## Looking for Developer Documentation?

This Spree user documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Spree e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Spree store can be found here.

If you are a developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](/developer) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.

BTW Give Spree a [GitHub Star](https://github.com/spree/spree)<Icon icon="star" iconType="solid" color="#FFD43B" />, why dont't ya?
