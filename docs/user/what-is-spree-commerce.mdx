## About Spree Commerce

Spree Commerce is an open-source eCommerce framework giving you full control and customizability.

Spree comes in two flavors - as a free Community Edition or as a paid Enterprise Edition.&#x20;

Spree is being used by thousands of businesses around the world, among them brans such as GoDaddy, GOOP, Bookshop.com, Bonobos, Huckberry, KFC, Mitchells, Stylemyle.&#x20;

## Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition

Spree Community Edition is free to use by anyone and is just perfect for small or hobby projects developed by skilled Ruby on Rails developers. It's the DIY version of Spree.&#x20;

Spree Enterprise Edition, available with a paid license, comes off-the-shelf with more features, more security, more integrations enabling you to go live faster and get all the latest improvements first.&#x20;

TL;DR The Community Edition gives you freedom. The Enterprise Edition saves you time.

So what sets both versions apart? Here's a [feature comparison](https://spreecommerce.org/pricing/) of the two editions and here's an [in-depth overview](https://spreecommerce.org/spree-commerce-version-comparison-community-edition-vs-enterprise-edition/).

## Looking for Developer Documentation?

This Spree user documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Spree e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Spree store can be found here.

If you are a Spree developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](/docs//developer) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.
