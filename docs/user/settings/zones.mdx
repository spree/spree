Zones allow you to define and group geographical areas (either by country or state) for greater control over how your store handles tax, shipping, and market settings. They allow you to carefully tailor your operations to specific regions.

To manage Zones, navigate to the Zones tab in the Settings menu.

## Zones Overview

![](/images/user/settings/zones/1.zones.png)

The Zones overview displays all existing zones with key details like:

- Name (e.g., “Asia”, “US States”, etc.)
- Description (e.g, Countries that make up the EU VAT zone)
- Default Tax Zone (Yes/No)

From here you can:

- Add a new zone
- Edit existing zones

## Add a New Zone

To add a new zone, click ‘New Zone’ in the top right corner, and you’ll be directed to a zone creation form.

Here you’ll see two sections that allow you to define the new zone:

### General Settings

![](/images/user/settings/zones/3.general_settings.png)

Here you can set:

- **Name**: Internal name of the zone (e.g., "US States", "Europe", "Asia")
- **Description**: Optional, used for internal clarification
- **Default Tax Zone**: Toggle if this should be the fallback zone for tax rules
- **Type**: Choose between Country-based or State-based

### Location Selection

This section differs based on the chosen Type:

#### Country-Based

If you choose the Country-based zone type, you’ll be presented with a multi-select list of countries. Select from options like:

- United States
- Japan
- Poland
- etc.

#### State-Based

If you choose the State-based zone type, you’ll first be asked to choose a country (e.g., United States). Then, you can select individual states from that country.

For example, if you choose the U.S., the options would include:

- California
- Texas
- New York
- Armed Forces (Africa, Americas, Pacific)
- etc.

<Note>
  You can add multiple states or countries to each zone depending on your needs.

## Edit a Zone

To edit a zone, simply click on the zone’s row in the Zones overview.

![](/images/user/settings/zones/6.edit_zone.png)

The edit form looks more or less identical to the New Zone form, but with pre-filled data, and Update buttons rather than Create buttons.

Here you can:

- Update the name and description
- Change the type (Warning: switching types will reset the current selections, this is irreversible)
- Add/remove Countries or States
- Toggle default tax zone as needed

## Delete a Zone

To delete a zone, simply navigate to the editor for the zone you wish to delete, and click the ‘Delete’ button on the lower righthand side.

## Saving Changes

After making any updates (besides after deleting a zone), make sure to click Create or Update at the bottom of the page to save your zone settings, otherwise any changes you’ve made will not be saved.

## Pro Tips

- Use state-based zones when you need tax/shipping rules for specific U.S. states.
- Use country-based zones for international markets or VAT jurisdictions.
- Only one zone can be the Default Tax Zone.
