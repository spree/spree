Shipping calculators determine how the cost of a shipping method is calculated at checkout.

When creating or editing a shipping method, you’ll choose a **Calculator** type and configure its rules. Each calculator applies different pricing logic depending on weight, order value, or number of items.

Below is a breakdown of each available shipping calculator and how it works.

## Flat Percent

Charges a percentage of the order total as the shipping cost.

**Configuration:**

- **Percentage** - The percent of the order total to charge

**Example:**\
If you set the percentage to **10%** and the order total is **\$200**, the shipping cost will be:

\$200 × 10% = \$20 shipping

**Best for:**

- Simple, scalable shipping rules
- Stores where shipping cost should increase proportionally with order value

## Flat Rate

Charges a fixed shipping cost based on weight and/or order total ranges.

**Configuration:**

- **Min Weight**
- **Max Weight**
- **Amount (cost)**
- **Currency**
- **Min Item Total**
- **Max Item Total**

The shipping cost applies only if the order falls within the defined weight and/or item total range.

**Example 1 (Weight-based):**

- Min weight: 0 kg
- Max weight: 5 kg
- Amount: \$15

Orders weighing between 0-5 kg will be charged \$15 shipping.

**Example 2 (Order total-based):**

- Min item total: \$0
- Max item total: \$100
- Amount: \$10

Orders between \$0-\$100 will be charged \$10 shipping.

**Best for:**

- Tiered shipping rules
- Heavy item pricing
- Conditional flat pricing

## Flexible Rate per Package Item

Charges one rate for the first item and a different rate for additional items in the shipment.

**Configuration:**

- **Max Items**
- **Currency**
- **First Item (cost)**
- **Additional Items (cost)**

**Example:**

- First item: \$10
- Additional items: \$3

If a customer orders 3 items:

\$10 (first item) + \$3 + \$3 = \$16 shipping

**Best for:**

- Small product stores
- Per-item handling costs

## Flat Rate per Package Item

Charges the same fixed amount for each item in the shipment.

**Configuration:**

- **Amount**
- **Currency**

**Example:**\
If the amount is **\$5 per item** and the order contains 4 items:

4 × \$5 = \$20 shipping

**Best for:**

- Uniform product sizes
- Standardized packaging costs

## Price Sack

Applies one shipping amount below a minimum order value, and a discounted rate above it.

**Configuration:**

- **Minimal Amount** - Order total threshold
- **Normal Amount** - Shipping cost below threshold
- **Discount Amount** - Shipping cost above threshold
- **Currency**

**How it works:**

- If the order total is **below** the minimal amount → Normal Amount is charged
- If the order total is **above** the minimal amount → Discount Amount is charged

**Example:**

- Minimal amount: \$100
- Normal amount: \$15
- Discount amount: \$5

If the order is:

- \$75 → Shipping = \$15
- \$150 → Shipping = \$5

**Best for:**

- Incentivizing higher order values
- “Spend \$100, get discounted shipping” promotions

## Digital Delivery

Used for digital products where shipping represents a processing or delivery fee.

**Configuration:**

- **Amount**
- **Currency**

In most cases, businesses selling digital products (such as e-books, software, or downloadable media) set this amount to 0, since no physical shipping is required. However, you may choose to apply a small processing fee if needed.

**Example:**\
If set to \$2, every order using this method will be charged \$2 for digital delivery.

**Best for:**

- E-books
- Software licenses
- Downloadable media
- Digital subscriptions

# Choosing the Right Calculator

Your choice depends on:

- Product weight variability
- Average order value
- Packaging costs
- Geographic complexity
- Whether you sell physical or digital goods

For more advanced shipping logic, calculators can also be combined with [Shipping Categories](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/settings/shipping-methods#shipping-categories) and [Zones](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/settings/zones) to apply different pricing rules to different products or regions.
