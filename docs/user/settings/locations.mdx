For large businesses with multiple warehouses, the ability to add multiple stock locations is essential for efficiently managing inventory across different regions. 

It ensures accurate stock tracking, optimizes order fulfillment, and enables faster shipping by routing orders from the nearest warehouse.

To set up and manage stock locations, navigate to **Settings → Locations**.
