In Spree, you can easily modify certain checkout settings directly from the dashboard - no developers needed. This gives you more control over the customer experience and lets you adapt quickly to your store’s needs.

To edit checkout settings, navigate to the Checkout tab of the Settings menu.

Here you’ll see two sections that allow you to modify certain aspects of the checkout:

## Checkout Message

<img src="/images/user/settings/checkout/2.checkout_message.png" />

This message appears in the right sidebar during checkout, and can be used to share helpful info, reminders, promos, or reassurance with customers.

You can format the message using the available editor tools (bold, italics, links, headings, etc.).

## Guest Checkout

Enable this option to let customers complete their purchase without creating an account or disable it to force users to create an account before purchasing.

<Note>By default this option is always enabled.</Note>

## Saving Changes

After making any updates, click Update at the bottom of the page to save your checkout settings, otherwise any changes you’ve made will not be saved.
