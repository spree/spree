Policies help define the rules of engagement between your store and your customers. They’re not just legal safeguards - they also build trust and set expectations. 

All policies added here will appear in your store’s footer and will be available to customers during checkout.

To set up your store policies, navigate to the Policies tab of the Settings menu.

In each case, simply copy and paste (or type) your policy into the associated text editor. Formatting is usually preserved when pasting, but you can also use the rich text editor tools to adjust the layout or style of your policies as needed.

## Terms of Service

This is a legal agreement between you and your customers. It outlines how your store operates, acceptable use, disclaimers, and liability limitations. Customers must accept it at signup. It's important for protecting your business in the event of disputes.

## Privacy Policy

This explains how customer data is collected, stored, and used. It's a legal requirement in most regions (like GDPR in the EU) and reassures customers that their data is handled responsibly.

## Returns Policy

Clearly states the conditions under which customers can return products. This reduces support queries and helps avoid misunderstandings. A transparent policy can also increase customer confidence and conversion rates.

## Shipping Policy

Provides details about delivery times, methods, and costs. It helps manage customer expectations and avoid frustration caused by delays or unexpected charges.

## Vendor Terms of Service (For marketplaces)

<Warning>The Vendor Terms of Service policy is only available (and relevant) to Spree Enterprise users running marketplaces.</Warning>

If you’re running a multi-vendor marketplace, this sets the rules vendors must agree to in order to sell on your platform. It could cover commission structure, responsibilities, content standards, and any platform-specific rules. This is essential for keeping vendor operations consistent and enforceable.
