Your store policies are an essential part of your eCommerce setup, helping you establish trust, maintain compliance, and communicate clearly with your customers. Spree allows you to easily manage these pages from the Policies tab.

You can create as many custom policy pages as you need, with full control over their content and URL structure.

The following four standard policies are added to every store by default:

- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Returns Policy
- Shipping Policy

These can be customized, deleted, or supplemented with additional policies depending on your business needs.

## Create a New Policy

To create a new policy, navigate to **Settings → Policies** in your Spree dashboard.

Simply enter data into the following fields:

- **Name** - displayed title on the storefront.
- **Slug** - URL identifier (e.g. /policies/custom-warranty).
- **Content** - enter your policy text using the rich text editor (supports formatting, links, media, etc.).

Then, click **Create** to save and publish your new policy.

Once published, the policy will be accessible from the storefront and can also be linked in your footer navigation or other relevant areas.
