Connecting a custom domain ensures your store is accessible via a branded, customer-friendly URL, rather than a technical or temporary address. It builds trust with users, strengthens brand identity, and improves discoverability through SEO.

### Add a Custom Domain

Adding custom domains in Spree is made simple with a convenient semi-automated process.

To add a custom domain, navigate to the Domains tab of the Settings menu.

Then follow these steps:

1. Click ‘Setup Domain’ and a window will appear
2. Enter the URL and click ‘Proceed’
3. Continue through the domain verification process (powered by Entri)
4. Complete verification with your domain provider

Once verified, the domain is automatically connected and enabled for use with your storefront.

The system handles most of the DNS configuration behind the scenes. However, if your domain is managed through a provider that isn’t supported for automated setup, you may be required to complete some manual DNS changes (instructions will be provided as needed).

<Note>Changes to DNS records may take some time to propagate, depending on your domain provider.</Note>
