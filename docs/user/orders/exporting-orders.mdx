As an admin, you might want to export order data for a variety of reasons - tracking sales trends, reconciling financial records, or sharing order details with other teams. Spree makes it easy to export this data in a clean CSV format.

## How to Export Orders

To export orders to CSV, navigate to the **Orders** tab of the admin dashboard.

Click the **Export** button in the top-right corner, and a popup will appear

<Note>
  If you only want to export a subset of the data, apply filters using the filter controls at the top of the order view before clicking Export.

Next, choose which records to export:

- **Filtered Records** - Exports only the orders currently visible based on your applied filters (e.g., date range, payment state).
- **All** - Exports the entire order history.

Once selected, click **Export**, annd a download link for the CSV file will be sent to the email address associated with your admin user account.
