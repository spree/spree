As an admin, you might want to export orders to CSV for reporting, analysis, or record-keeping, allowing you to track sales trends, reconcile financial data, or share order details with other teams. 

To export order history, navigate to the Orders tab of the admin dashboard.

Here you can choose to export one of two options:

* Filtered Records - exports only filtered records that match the search criteria

* All - exports all records

Once you’ve made your choice, click export and the CSV file will be sent to the email address associated with your admin user account.

All historical exports will also be available for download in the Audit Trail tab of the Settings menu.
