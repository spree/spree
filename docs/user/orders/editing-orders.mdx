Editing orders from the admin dashboard is essential for providing excellent customer support, allowing you to correct any mistakes, update shipping details, or modify items in response to customer requests. This often relevant in B2B scenarios, where orders often require adjustments due to bulk pricing, custom agreements, or changing inventory availability.

To edit an order, navigate to the Orders tab of the admin dashboard.

Find and click on the order you’d like to edit and you’ll be redirected to the order editor.

<img height="360" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcMvzJ22fU-hY5819XnApuT1vm5xdo6KVfvaHOziDQUShSxo8Zby2_8-WSiZ4u1BiB_j67stDLyWIrridxFMEKqfTcGx3cxGVhYAhGeXAGP0LPu4uh-X_-nnhNe4RM9LF4RenM5Yg?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Here you’ll be able to modify any part of the order, besides the order number. 

Let’s explore the different parts of an order that can be modified.

## Add Line Items

You might want to add line items to an order to accommodate customer requests, such as adding additional products, upgrading items, or including promotional gifts. 

This is particularly useful in B2B transactions, where bulk orders may need adjustments, or in cases where a customer wants to bundle more items without placing a new order.

To add line items, click ‘+ Add line item’ in the top section and select the variants to be added to the order.

<img height="360" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfmcER7YvUX_xfPANLFcrH-cQIDCnUWPgIXzngDxRcXl78mDa03Ay5BLb-bZxOOhiguhMn2mA1G1umj4g9mxMhaUUnCIzUBRK-3TJWHdWC5Pp3Qacs2gLuxQSvh9i0jqlmW-sz5xQ?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

You can also adjust the quantity of existing line items by clicking on ‘Show details’ to reveal the line items, and then clicking the pencil icon to edit the quantity.

<img height="343" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd05LFrduipUisc7Knrh0mhK_ZyAZtU89r99adOiltfTB5KCPV0Fl-5n2Q7TdedQYthmE3lHUZcz1S8vLkIc5eSPm49WWkbgp7DbcCvaegsvfiBlFaXj5RUe1Rv0zyTO5_h81Qobw?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Important: Whether the payment status of the order is paid or balance due, a new payment will need to be added to account for the price of the newly added line items (unless, e.g., it’s been added as a free gift)

## Remove Line Items

On the other hand, you might remove line items from an order to correct errors, accommodate customer requests for changes, or adjust for out-of-stock items. 

This is useful for handling partial cancellations, issuing partial refunds, or modifying B2B orders where quantities and product selections frequently change.

To remove a line item, click ‘Show details’ to reveal the line items, click the pencil icon next to the line item to be removed, and then click ‘Delete’.

<img height="343" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcMWk23e_sDDfo7HO4iTL4rIZK7snQvAcqdj_Bbg0xsGfj_26c5N1weJfk1gwjSzQeKiDGaFG_CutUx7NCluyRrwrMKpiJ-ZE0UYRUD30g8DJSj38ATjvnzrpP9pAH5MIloAHGj-w?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Important: If the order has already been paid for, you’ll need to issue a partial refund for the order. If the balance is due, you’ll need to remove the current payment and add a new payment with the correct amount.

## Change Addresses

In some cases, you might need to change the shipping or billing address to correct customer input errors, accommodate last-minute address updates, or resolve payment discrepancies. 

This is useful when a customer moves, provides an incorrect address, or requests delivery to a different location, ensuring a smooth and accurate order fulfillment process.

To change the shipping or billing address, click the three dots in the top right corner of the Customer section and edit the address accordingly.

<img height="347" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdpV5aT9A5_QUxbOax8IoV3Qt_s2lhj9StDycz0H2GbhKxerPqTPoQFMaf8sYpK16makwvb6P_L5PpLg-A0A5yFDQhWf2SEnapSwbAHc2j03E0898kWPk-poYzFplpSt6ApiNO-Kw?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Important: If updating the shipping address results in a change of shipping zone (e.g., from North America to South America), you may need to adjust the shipping method to match the available options for the new zone.

## Change Fulfillment Location

As an admin, you might want to change the fulfillment location for a line item to optimize shipping times, manage inventory across multiple warehouses, or accommodate customer preferences. 

For example, this is useful when an item is out of stock at the original location but available elsewhere, ensuring faster delivery and better order fulfillment efficiency.

To change the fulfillment location for a line item, click on the split arrow icon next to the line in the shipment section of the order, and select the optimal location from the dropdown. <img height="385" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9CFD4a1O93di5cl953ic4pc53s_tqe6sAQ-TUVUsz02bkQaqQlfAw2nQL2EKNe1T6mS7EC2UstiQYEGXkB4ZabFYAMXZvyqzA9EI4HLx4MKXk99aKd3UZXPcc8FYni3lkqHLLtQ?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Doing so will split the order into two shipments, each with its own shipping method and cost.

<img height="409" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe4d5DQrQPC6mNyIx4NOysNjJ_dcWaBlxt2nWvrphBEfN05DLsUBEiRtp85Ouz4ZH6YtmAdA-z04nJewhFxn1NvJ96jsD3F2vMW5336Vnekj9f3eeE0V9PQD05Yp-68reYAKe4c?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Important: Since another shipping cost is being added to the order, you’ll need to update the payment amount.

## Change Shipping Methods

To meet customer requests, expedite delivery, or adjust for carrier availability, you may also want to change shipping methods for an order. 

Examples could be upgrading to faster shipping, accommodating address changes, or resolving issues like unexpected delays or cost adjustments.

To change a shipping method, click the pencil icon next to the current shipping method.

<img height="293" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1lUdd_64xDaHf5iTHFgbxCdJtHpBpTOOQXMWP6x895Y8mKgWMLY83wxpbsRgduMWnjWC9iQuwUCIVCH9s1JfY9So0mOcG-W8JcCYyLReWcT5OoeXnZdmJufSfm6vgErhfP8Nkwg?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Then, select the preferred shipping methods from the dropdown and click ‘Save’.

<img height="293" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXctIaXRD8rrFzFFGDQt6LXm0fC6i8e_HbRHe6CUVgoqTzvOTXeqcDXx5e8Up2gJOSOMCHhKLpw7R5QsH88hkGsQJbB5PwBd0_wQzBm31sE91C8I_MEm8Jk9Oez9PRIgmY3c5ci1wQ?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Important: If the price of the new shipping method is different from the previous one, you’ll need to update the payment amount for the order.

## Add Payments

Adding a payment to an order is critical to ensure that the order remains balanced and properly accounted for, especially when modifications increase the total cost. 

This is crucial for cases like adding new items, upgrading shipping, or processing manual transactions in B2B sales, preventing discrepancies in financial records and order fulfillment.

To add a payment to an order, there are 3 options to choose from:

### Create a New Payment

To manually add a payment , click on the ‘+ New Payment Method’ button. This will redirect you to a page where you can create a new payment for the order.

<img height="360" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdHoCpjYif4sM5fOr9EJRRUo02rFk-LNYM4Qfe9kbF8tBD-FHafRd41jjBoqYUgkHtvetyHjXQzj9pAlLhhoZttB8Y6C73nRlhBt2Eo6myfC7CUisErj7IMvpBt8AIMDo9bdtA4yA?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Here, you can set:

* Amount - equals total order value by default

* Payment Method - a list of payment methods available on your store

* Payment Source - a list of the customer’s saved cards or accounts associated with the payment method

Once you’ve verified the information is correct, click ‘Create’ to add the payment to the order. 

<img height="173" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcEO3FxQLUm15T3r02c6FR6hlvP7NMGLRs5QGMqeFHJBaoP0U601PqTBkqcP2pIO_sO7MacPr75GslW5ge7bH2jEyC-OkaEUzBfCEKk5Zzl-EU94Cqfe5PSWjwdK4PQQpgbGpO3?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

Note: Depending on the chosen payment method and its settings, the payment may or may not be automatically captured.

<img height="173" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXejyXFXZslz6oSSUvLqzR7F_TeDrsydAFbIgAMiDjR0zVrjyN1EyVOLO-mxvaTr1Pr8DYSddQBktj1SV6u55LgEhw7uBXpniVJcUG_FNAeMesNsfL7juszK_hXc0YF8hshCMl3D?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

In the above example, we added a Stripe payment method using the customer’s saved card as the payment source.

Note: If the customer has no payment sources (i.e., credit/debit cards) associated with a particular payment method, you will not be able to create a payment using that method.

### Send a Payment Link

Alternatively, you can send the customer a payment link by email. The customer will receive a link that redirects them to a pre-populated checkout where they can choose to pay for the order using any of the payment methods available on your store.

Note: The customer must be logged in to complete the purchase.

### Copy Payment Link

Similar to above, but instead you copy the link and can send it to the customer via the preferred communication channel.

### Remove Payments

Removing a payment from an order may occasionally be required to correct errors, handle a failed or incorrect transaction, or to update the payment amount. 

This is useful in cases where a customer overpaid, changed their payment method, or canceled part of the order, ensuring accurate financial records and proper order adjustments.

To remove a payment, click the three dots next to the payment and click ‘Delete.

<img height="257" width="624" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdWdkCt99jErHHXTqVxF5kRlgNWTAV0NAl8Ik0aSMgSp1vKD5_emWbQ7bum9WyZcqBWgKGpJBuqvrtMGkkCoE-abadNn6cvO3vO98UtQ56SEhFo_4ouFbpNSICVm5nPLerc0XHFLw?key=e7i87pyuxR_6774mYUKmBI5R" />

If the payment status is Paid, then you cannot remove the payment. Instead, it must be refunded. To learn about refunding orders, please refer to a separate support article.
