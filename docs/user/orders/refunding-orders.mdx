It’s extremely important to be able to refund orders to resolve customer complaints, process returns, or correct billing errors. This helps maintain customer satisfaction, comply with refund policies, and ensure accurate financial records.

To refund an order, navigate to the Orders tab of the admin dashboard.

Once you’ve set the correct amount and the reason, click ‘Create ‘ and the payment status of the order will be updated to ‘Refunded’.

Important: The refund process depends on the payment method - some refunds are issued automatically (e.g., via Stripe), while others may require manual processing (e.g., for offline payments). Always double check the payment method and make sure the refund is issued accordingly.
