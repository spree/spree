Refunding orders is a key part of running a smooth ecommerce operation. Whether you're handling customer complaints, returns, or correcting billing errors, issuing refunds helps maintain trust, ensure financial accuracy, and stay compliant with store policies.

## How to Refund an Order

To refund an order, navigate to the **Orders** tab in the admin dashboard.

Click on the order you'd like to refund to open its detail page.

Scroll to the **Payments** section, and click the **three-dot menu** to the right of the payment you want to refund and select **Refund**.

This will open a simple refund form.

## Completing the Refund

On the refund page, you’ll be able to:

- **Set the refund amount** (full or partial)
- **Choose a refund reason** from the dropdown

Once complete, click **Create** to process the refund.

The order’s payment state will be updated to reflect the refund:

- **Refunded** for full refunds
- **Partially Refunded** if only a portion was refunded

<Warning>Refund behavior depends on the payment method. Some providers (like Stripe) automatically process refunds. Others (like offline/manual payments) may require you to issue the refund manually outside of Spree. Always double-check which payment method was used and whether the refund was successfully processed through your payment provider</Warning>
