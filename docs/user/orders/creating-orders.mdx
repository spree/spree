Depending on your business model, creating orders manually may be a common workflow - whether it’s to handle customer service scenarios, B2B orders, or backend sales operations. Follow this step by step guided flow that lets you build the order step by step.

## 1. Start a New Order

Navigate to the **Orders** tab in the admin dashboard and click **New Order** in the top-right corner.

![How to create orders in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/1-creating-orders.png)

You’ll be redirected to a short order setup form where you must:

- **Select Currency** - choose the appropriate currency for the order
- **Choose a Customer**
  - Select an existing customer
  - _OR_ enter a new customer’s email to create a customer record on the fly

Once these details are filled in, click **Create** to continue.

## 2. Add Line Items

![Adding line items to an order in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/3-add-line-items.png)

You’ll now land on the order editor, with the order in draft status. 

Begin by clicking **Add Line Item** at the top of the page to add items to the order.

![Selecting variants for an order in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/4-select-line-items.png)

Search and select the desired product variant and click **Add Selected Variant** to add it to the order

<Note>You can only add one product variant at a time. Repeat the step for multiple items.</Note>

## 3. Shipping & Billing Address Logic

After you add the first line item, Spree handles customer addresses based on whether it’s a new or existing customer:

### Existing Customer

![Adding an existing customer to a Spree Commerce order](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/5-existing-customer.png)

The customers default shipping and billing addresses are automatically used, but you can edit them via the **three-dot menu** in the Customer section.

### New Customer 

![Adding a new customer to an order on the fly in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/6-new-customer.png)

You must manually add a shipping and billing address:

1. Locate the **Customer** section
2. Click **\+ New Shipping Address** and fill in the form
3. Click **\+ New Billing Address** (or select "Same as Shipping")

## 4. Add a Shipping Method

![Adding a shipping method to an order in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/7-shipment-section.png)

Once a line item is added, a shipment will appear in the Shipment section, with a default shipping method selected.

To change it:

1. Click the **pencil (edit)** icon next to the shipping method
2. Select the desired method from the dropdown
3. Click **Save**

## 5. Apply Promotions

Admins can manually apply valid **Promotion Codes** to the order. To do so:

1. Scroll to the **Promotions** section
2. Click **\+ Add Promotion Code**
3. Enter the coupon code and apply it

If valid, any applicable discounts will be reflected in the order total.

## 6. Add Order Adjustments

To manually adjust the order total (e.g., for discounts, fees, or custom credits):

1. Scroll to the **Adjustments** section
2. Click **\+ New Adjustment**
3. Enter a **Label** and set an **Amount**:
   1. Positive amount = charge
   2. Negative amount  = credit
4. Click **Create**

Adjustments will be reflected in the cost summary.

## 7. Add a Payment

![Adding a payment to an order in the Spree Commerce dashboard](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/10-add-payment.png)

There are three options for applying payment to the order:

### Create a Manual Payment

![Manually creating a payment for an order in the Spree dashboard](/docs/images/user/orders/creating-orders/11-new-payment.png)

Click **\+ New Payment Method** and fill in:

- **Amount** - defaults to order total
- **Payment Method** - e.g., Stripe, bank transfer, etc.
- **Payment Source** - saved card (if available)

Click **Create** to add the payment.

<Note>If the customer has no saved card, you won’t be able to use some methods.</Note>

### Send a Payment Link

Email the customer a secure checkout link. They must be logged in to complete it.

### Copy Payment Link

Copy the link and send it via your preferred communication method.

## 8. Fulfill the Order

Once all items, payments, promos, and adjustments are in place, you can proceed to ship the order once you have received payment from the customer. For details on fulfillment, see [<u>Processing Orders</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/orders/processing-orders).
