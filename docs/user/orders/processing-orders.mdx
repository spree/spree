Efficient order processing is essential for running a successful ecommerce business. In Spree, processing an order typically involves two key steps: capturing payment and fulfilling the order.

To process an order, navigate to the Orders tab of the Spree dashboard.

From here, simply click on the order you want to process to open the order page.

Here you’ll see a full overview of the order, including payment and shipment details.

## Payment Capture

![Capturing payments in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/processing-orders/3-order-payment.png)

Some businesses (especially B2C) choose to auto-capture payments when an order is placed. Others prefer to manually capture payments later - for example, after stock is verified or fraud checks are completed.

<Note>If you are auto-capturing payments, proceed to Order Fulfillment.</Note>

If the order has a Balance Due payment status, follow one of the options below:

### Option 1: Manually Capture an Existing Payment

![Manually capturing payments in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/processing-orders/4-capture-payment.png)

If the payment is already authorized (e.g., via credit card or bank transfer), you can capture it manually:

1. Click the **three-dot menu** next to the existing payment.
2. Select **Capture**.

The payment status will update to Paid, and you will now be able to fulfill the order via the shipment section.

### Option 2: Add a New Payment

If the original payment failed, or if the customer wants to pay via a different method, you can create a new payment.

Simply click the **New Payment** to open the payment creation form, and fill out the fields

- Amount (defaults to order total)
- Payment Method
- Payment Source (e.g. saved credit card)

Click **Create** to finalize the new payment.

You can now either:

- Capture the payment immediately if the details are saved
- Send a payment link for the customer to complete the payment manually

<Note>Depending on the payment method used for the order, the refund or capture process may happen automatically or may require manual action.</Note>

## Order Fulfillment

Once payment has been captured, you're ready to fulfill the order via the **Shipments** section.

Before shipping, make sure you have:

- The correct tracking number
- The correct carrier, based on the customer’s shipping selection

### Add Tracking Details

![Adding a tracking number to an order in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/orders/processing-orders/7-tracking-number.png)

To add tracking details to the shipment:

1. Click the **\+** icon in the Tracking subsection.
2. Enter the tracking number.
3. Click **Save**.

### Ship the Order

Double-check that everything is correct and click **Ship** to complete the order.

The order’s shipment status will update to **Shipped**, and the customer will receive a confirmation email with tracking details.

## Order Completed

![A completed orders in the Spree Commerce dashboard](/docs/images/user/orders/processing-orders/8-order-complete.png)

At this point, the order will have:

- **Payment State**: Paid
- **Shipment State**: Shipped

This means the order has been successfully processed and is now complete from your business’ point of view. All that’s left is for the customer to receive their shipment.
