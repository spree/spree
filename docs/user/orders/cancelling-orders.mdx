There may be times when you need to cancel an order, whether to accommodate a customer request, flag a fraudulent transaction, or resolve issues with inventory or payments.

Spree allows you to cancel orders directly from the admin dashboard in just a few steps.

## How to Cancel an Order

Navigate to the **Orders** tab of the admin dashboard.

Find and click on the order you want to cancel to open its detail page.

In the top-right corner, click the **three-dot menu**, then select **Cancel Order** from the dropdown.

Once confirmed, the order will be cancelled and its status will be updated automatically.

<Warning>
  Cancelling an order is irreversible.
</Warning>

## What Happens After Cancellation

### Order Status

- The order’s shipment state will be updated to Cancelled.
- The payment state may also change to Void or Refunded, depending on whether payment has already been captured.

### Payment Refunds

Refunds are not always automatic. Whether the payment is refunded depends on:

- Your payment service provider (PSP)
- The payment method used
- Whether the payment had already been captured

If the payment state does not change to Refunded, you'll need to issue a refund manually.
