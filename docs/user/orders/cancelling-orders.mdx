Occasionally, it might be necessary to cancel orders to accommodate customer requests, address fraudulent transactions, or resolve inventory or payment issues. 

To cancel an order, navigate to the Orders tab of the admin dashboard.

Depending on the payment service provider, the payment method, and whether or not the order has already been paid, the payment may or may not be automatically refunded.

If the payment status is not updated to ‘Refunded’, you’ll need to refund the payment manually. To do so, please refer to the support article on Refunding Orders.
