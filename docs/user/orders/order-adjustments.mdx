# Order Adjustments

Order adjustments let you manually add a charge or credit to an existing order - ideal for handling things like special fees, discounts, or post-purchase updates.

## How to Create an Adjustment

To create an order adjustment, navigate to the **Orders** tab in the admin dashboard.

Find the order you'd like to adjust and click on it to open the order page.

Scroll to the **Adjustments** section and click **New Adjustment** to open the adjustment creation form.

Fill out the form:

- **Label** - A name for the adjustment (e.g., "Custom Discount", "Packaging Fee")
- **Amount** - Use a **positive value** for a charge or a **negative value** for a credit.

Finally, click **Create** to add the new adjustment.

## Handling the Payment or Refund

Once the adjustment has been created, it will need to be settled manually. Depending on whether it’s a charge or credit, follow one of the steps below:

### Credit (Negative Amount)

To manually refund the adjustment amount, click the **three-dot menu** next to the payment and select **Refund**.

This will open a refund form where you can enter the amount to be refunded.

After entering the amount and selecting a refund reason, click **Create** to process the refund.

<Note>Refund behavior depends on the payment method used - some refunds can be processed automatically, while others may require manual handling.</Note>

### Charge (Positive Amount)

There are two methods to charge a customer in the event of a positive adjustment.

### Automatated Payment

To charge a customer, click **New Payment** in the Payments section.

This will open the payment form where you can select the amount to charge the customer and the payment method to be charged.

Click **Create** after entering the details. The customer’s payment method will then be automatically charged for the outstanding balance.

### Send Payment Link

Alternatively, you can send the customer a payment link by email. The customer will receive a link that redirects them to a checkout where they can choose to pay for the outstanding balance using any of the payment methods available on your store.

## Close the Adjustment

Once the adjustment has been handled, click the **three-dot menu** next to the adjustment, and select **Close** to mark the adjustment as finalized.
