Searching orders is useful when you need to quickly locate a specific order by customer name, order ID, or date, especially during high-volume sales periods. It also helps resolve customer inquiries faster by providing access to order details without navigating through multiple pages.

To search orders, navigate to the Orders tab of the admin dashboard.

Above the order listing, you’ll notice a search bar and some filtering options.

## Search

The search bar is the most efficient way to find orders when the order ID number is known, e.g., R983993265.

## Date

Orders can be filtered by date either by selecting a predefined time period or setting a custom range. 

To do so, simply select the desired time period from the calendar dropdown (by default this is set to ‘All Time’).

## Status

Orders can also be filtered by status, making it easy to see how many need action and quickly identify the appropriate steps to take.

To do so, select the order state from the ‘Show’ dropdown (by default this is set to ‘All Orders’).

## Filters

Filters help refine your search by allowing you to be more specific with your criteria, such as First Name, Last Name, Email, SKU, and Promotion. In Spree Enterprise Edition, you can also search by Vendor.

To apply filters, click the ‘Filters’ button on the right side of the search bar, input the search criteria, and click ‘Filter Results’.

## Orders to Fulfill

Unfulfilled orders are arguably the most important to pay attention to because they represent pending commitments that directly impact customer satisfaction and retention. 

Addressing these orders promptly helps ensure timely shipping, reduces the risk of negative reviews or cancellations, and maintains a smooth order fulfillment process.

To quickly filter by unfulfilled orders, click on ‘Orders to Fulfill’ found underneath ‘Orders’ in the side menu.
