Currently, admin users cannot create custom reports directly from the dashboard.

Fortunately, Spree’s reporting system is designed to be extensible, making it straightforward for developers to build custom reports tailored to your specific operational and analytical needs.

If you need a custom report tailored to your business requirements, please ask your developer to review our [<u>developer documentation</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/developer/core-concepts/reports).

## Requesting a Custom Report

When requesting a new report from your developer, it helps to clearly define:

- What business question you’re trying to answer
- Which resource needs reporting (products, orders, customers, etc.)
- Which data fields you need included
- Any filters required (e.g., date range, customer group, region)
- Preferred format (dashboard view, CSV export, scheduled export, etc.)
- Currency requirements (if multi-currency is enabled)
