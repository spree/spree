The Customer Profile gives you a complete view of a customer’s activity, order history, and account details - all in one place. It helps you better understand purchasing behavior, identify high-value customers, and provide faster, more personalized support.

## Accessing a Customer Profile

To access a customer’s profile, navigate to **Customers** in the admin dashboard.

Find the customer you’d like to review (use search and filters if needed), and click on the customer’s name to open their profile.
