Depending on your business model, you might want to create customers manually when processing phone or in-person orders or when migrating data from another platform. 

This ensures all customer details are accurately recorded in the system, allowing for better order tracking, personalized service, and marketing opportunities.

To create a customer, navigate to the Customers tab of the admin dashboard.

Click on the ‘\+ Create Customer’ in the top right corner to open the customer creation form.

Simply type in the customers details (only an email address is required) and click ‘Create’ and you’ll be redirected to the newly created customers admin page.

Tip: Add customer tags like "VIP," "Frequent Buyer," or "Wholesale" to categorize customers based on purchasing behavior or status. Other tags such as "New Customer," "Flagged for Review," or "High-Value" can help streamline marketing efforts, customer service, and order management.

Now that the customer has been created, you can add additional information such as the shipping and billing addresses.

## Add a Shipping Address

To add a shipping address, click ‘\+ Add’ in the Shipping Address section. This will reveal a form that will allow you to input the customer address.

After entering the address, click create and the new shipping address will be saved.

## Add a Billing Address

By default, the billing address will be set to ‘Same as shipping address’, but you can enter a different address by clicking on ‘Edit’ in the billing address section, and selecting ‘Add New Address’.

This will reveal a form in the same way as described above. Simply enter the correct billing address and click ‘Create’ to save it.

With this information added, the customer can now be added to manual orders at the click of a button.

Note: If the customer would like to access their user account, they’ll need to initiate a password reset on the storefront using the email address associated with their account.

Congratulations, you’ve just created a customer account\!
