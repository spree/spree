Occasionally, you may need to edit a customer’s profile to update contact details, addresses, or preferences for accurate order fulfillment and communication. This is especially common if your sales process frequently includes off-site or manual order entries.

To edit a customer’s profile, navigate to the Customers tab of the admin dashboard.

Find and click on the customer you’d like to edit and you’ll be redirected to their Customer Profile page.
