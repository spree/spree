You may need to edit a customer’s profile to correct contact details, update addresses, manage tags, or adjust account-related settings. This is especially common when handling phone orders, B2B accounts, or customer support requests.

## How to Edit a Customer

To edit a customer, navigate to **Customers** in the admin dashboard.

![How to edit a customer profile in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/customers/editing-customers/1-customers-tab.png)

Find and click the customer you’d like to update to open their **Customer Profile** page.

![The customer profile overview in the Spree dashboard](/docs/images/user/customers/editing-customers/2-customer-profile.png)

From here, there are several sections of the customer profile that you may edit when necessary.

## Contact Details

![Customer contact details section in the Spree dashboard](/docs/images/user/customers/editing-customers/3-contact-details.png)

In the **Details** section, click **Edit** to open the edit form and modify:

- Email address
- Phone number
- First and last name
- Email marketing opt-in / opt-out status
- Tags
- Customer Group (if applicable)

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Shipping Address

In the **Shipping Address** section, click **Edit** to reveal the address editor form, and update the customer’s default shipping address as required.

<Note>Updating the shipping address in the customer profile does not change the address on existing or outstanding orders. To modify an order’s shipping address, edit the order directly from the **Orders** tab.</Note>

## Billing Address

![Editing the customer billing address in the Spree dashboard](/docs/images/user/customers/editing-customers/5-billing-address.png)

In the **Billing Address** section, click **Edit** to modify the customer’s default billing address.

You’ll then be able to choose between:

- **Same as shipping address**, or
- **Add a new address**

Selecting **Add a new address** will reveal the address form, where you can enter the updated billing details. Click **Update** to apply your changes.

<Note>As with shipping addresses, updating the billing address here will not affect existing orders.</Note>

## Internal Notes

The **Internal Note** section allows admins to leave private notes about a customer (for example, special handling instructions, account context, or support history).

To add or update an internal note:

1. Click **Edit** in the Internal Note section
2. Enter your note
3. Click **Save**

<Note>Internal notes are only visible to admins and are never shown on the storefront.</Note>

## Issue Gift Cards

You can issue a gift card directly from the customer profile.

Click the **three-dot menu** in the top right corner and select **Add Gift Card**.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [<u>Issue a Gift Card</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/customers/issue-gift-card) support article.

## Issue Store Credits
