Gift cards are prepaid balances that can be redeemed like cash on future purchases. They’re commonly used for promotions, customer service gestures, loyalty rewards, or as products sold directly to customers.

In Spree, you can issue gift cards to individual customers or generate them in bulk for later distribution. This guide covers how to issue a gift card to a specific customer.

## Issue a Gift Card

To issue a gift card, navigate to **Customers** in the admin dashboard.
