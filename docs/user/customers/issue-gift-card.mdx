Gift cards are prepaid balances that can be purchased or issued and redeemed like cash on future purchases, often with no expiration date.

In Spree, you can create and issue gift cards directly to specific customers or generate them in bulk for distribution at a later time.

This guide covers issuing a gift card to a specific customer.

To issue a gift card to a customer, navigate to the Customers tab of the admin dashboard.

The customer field will automatically be filled and uneditable, but you can enter values for the following fields:

- Code - you can leave this blank and Spree will automatically generate a code
- Amount - the amount to be placed on the gift card (required)
- Minimum Order Amount - a minimum order value to use the gift card, can be set to 0 (required)
- Expires At - the gift card’s expiration date, leave it blank for a non-expiring card

Click ‘Create’ once you’re finished and the gift card will be added to the customer’s account.
