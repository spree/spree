Customer Groups let you segment your customers into defined lists, which can then be used to personalize pricing, limit access to promotions, or power other business rules.

They’re especially useful when used with:

- **Price List Rules** - apply custom pricing to specific customer groups.
- **Promotion Rules** - restrict eligibility to certain customer segments (e.g. wholesale, VIP, B2B).

## Create a Customer Group

To create a new customer group, navigate to **Customers → Customer Groups** in the admin dashboard.

Here you’ll see an overview of all existing customer groups, including the number of customers in each.

Click the **New Customer Group** button in the top right to begin setup.

## Add Group Details

In the creation form, add:

- Name - This is how the group will appear in admin interfaces
- Description - Use this field to describe the purpose of the group, e.g. “North America wholesale buyers” or “Early access testers” (optional)

Click **Create** to save the new group.

## Add Customers to the Group

Once the group is created, you’ll be taken to its detail view.

To add customers to the group, click the **Add Customers** button, and a side panel will open where you can search and select customers to add.
