## Filters

For more advanced searches, click **Filters** to build custom filter rules.

You can create filter groups using **AND** / **OR** logic and apply conditions using the following operators:

- equals
- does not equal
- greater than
- greater than or equal
- less than
- less than or equal
- is any of
- is none of
- is empty
- is not empty

### **Available Filter Fields**

You can filter customers by:

- Email marketing (opted in or not)
- Location
- Created at
- Updated at
- First Name
- Last Name
- Tags

Multiple filters can be combined to narrow down results - for example, finding customers who have opted into email marketing and were created within a specific timeframe.
