Being able to effectively search for customers is important for quickly locating specific profiles, especially during customer service interactions or order inquiries. It can also help you efficiently update details, review purchase history, or manage tags to improve personalized service and marketing efforts.

To search for customers, navigate to the Customers tab of the admin dashboard.

Above the customer list, you’ll notice a search bar and some filtering options.

## Search

The search bar is the most efficient way to find a customer when you know their email address or full name.

## Filters

Filters help refine your search and are especially useful when exporting customer lists.

To access filtering options, click the ‘Filters’ button next to the search bar.
