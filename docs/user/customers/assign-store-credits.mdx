Store credits allow you to add funds directly to a customer’s account. Unlike gift cards, store credits are tied to a specific customer and cannot be transferred. They are commonly used for refunds, compensation, or loyalty rewards.

In more advanced use cases, store credits can serve as the primary payment method - particularly in B2B scenarios where customers operate on prepaid balances or agreed credit thresholds that they draw from over time.

## How to Issue Store Credits

To issue store credits, navigate to **Customers** in the admin dashboard.

You can issue store credit in two ways:
- Click the **three-dot menu** in the top right corner and select **Add Store Credit**
- Or click **Add Store Credit** directly from the analytics section at the top of the customer profile
