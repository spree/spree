Store credit is typically issued as a refund or compensation for returns and is usually tied to a specific customer account, rather than being transferable or gifted as with gift cards. They can also be used in use cases that include loyalty systems or reward points.

To assign store credits to a customer, navigate to the Customers tab of the admin dashboard.

Find and click on the customer who will be receiving the store credits to open their customer profile page.

You’ll be redirected to a page where you can set the amount and currency (if your store supports more than one currency) of store credits to be issued. You can also add a memo, such as a note explaining the reason for the store credit assignment.
