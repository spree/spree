When first logging in to your instance of Spree Commerce [open-source eCommerce platform](https://spreecommerce.org/), you’ll be greeted with the Getting Started tab which, by default, outlines 4 onboarding tasks you’ll need to complete.

/>

Once you’ve completed these tasks, this tab will disappear.

Let’s take a look at each task in more detail.

## Set up payments

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that in order to sell anything, you need to accept payments, and in order to accept payments, you need to add payment methods.

To setup payment methods, click on the blue button which will redirect you to the Payment Methods section of Settings.

<img
  alt="Payment Methods"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.2_Getting_Started_-_Payment_Methods_danmea.png"
/>

At the top, there’s a list of added payment methods, each of which you can toggle on/off, change its visibility on the storefront or admin panel, and edit. The Store Credits payment methods is always added by default, but alone it does not enable to accept payments from customers.

Below that, you’ll see a list of available payment methods that you can add to your store.

Find the method you’d like to use and click ‘\+ Add’. This will redirect you to the set up page for that particular payment method.

Important: to use any of these available payment methods, you are required to first set up an account with the associated payment service provider.

<img
  alt="Create Payment Method"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.3_Getting_Started_-_Create_Payment_Method_i0xp8m.png"
/>

Simply follow the steps outlined for that payment method, click Create, and the payment method will be added to your store.

  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.4_Getting_Started_-_Payment_Method_Added_eojwfj.png"
/>

## Add products

Next on the list is adding products.

  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.5_Getting_Started_-_Add_Products_cxbdq5.png"
/>

There are three ways to add products to your store:

1. Adding products manually
2. Importing products with CSV
3. Inviting vendors (3rd party products)

Please refer to the respective articles for more information on each method of adding products.

<Note>
  Inviting 3rd party vendors to your marketplace is only available in the Spree Enterprise Edition.

## Set customer support email

The next task is a simple one, but it plays a very important role.

<img

  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.6_Getting_Started_-_Add_Customer_Support_Email_ahnei4.png"
/>

You need to add a customer support email to display on your storefront. This email serves as a contact point for your customers to reach out to you if they have any queries or require support.

Simply type in the email address you’d like to use and click save.

## Setup taxes collection

The last task to complete in the Getting Started is setting up taxes collection.

<img
  alt="Setup Taxes Collection"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.7_Getting_Started_-_Setup_Taxes_Collection_nwt1zn.png"
/>

Follow the link in the description and you’ll be redirected to the Tax section of Settings.

To learn more about setting up taxes, please refer to a separate support article.

## Shipping Methods

To allow customers to actually place orders, there must be shipping methods available for them to select on checkout.

You can add shipping methods by navigating to the Shipping section in Settings.

<img
  alt="Shipping Methods"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.8_Getting_Started_-_Shipping_Methods_ailaai.png"
/>

To add a new shipping method, click the blue button in the top right corner. This will open to shipping method editor.

  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.9_Getting_Started_-_Add_A_Shipping_Method_wf4ajh.png"
/>

Here you can configure the settings of the shipping method, such as the shipping zones, calculator and costs, and estimated delivery time.

For more information about shipping methods, please refer to a separate support article.

## Basic Storefront Setup

Now that you’ve configured payments, taxes, and shipping, and added some products, it’s time to configure your storefront.

Spree comes with a drag and drop page builder with pre-built page sections that allows you to quickly and easily configure a storefront. This is a great option for MVPs or other projects that don’t require a lot of custom frontend features.

If you’re planning on using Spree in headless mode and connect it to a separate storefront application, please refer to [Spree developer documentation](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/developer/getting-started/quickstart).

The Storefront tab of the admin dashboard, found under Channels & Apps, contains four sections that manage various parts of your storefront.

### Theme

This is where you can modify the layout and look and feel of your storefront.

<img
  alt="Theme"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.10_Getting_Started_-_Theme_nmwoh4.png"
/>

#### View Store

To view the live storefront, click on the View Store button on the top right corner. If you haven’t modified the theme at all, you’ll see what is essentially a blank slate with a few default page sections, and perhaps some products if you’ve made them Active.

<img
  alt="View_Store"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327023/docs/Getting%20Started/1.11_Getting_Started_-_View_Store_jynqgp.png"
/>

With a little investment of your time, you can turn this into something presentable, shoppable, and on-brand without the need to hire developers (or even designers if it’s an MVP).

<img
  alt="Styled Store on Spree"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327026/docs/Getting%20Started/1.12_Getting_Started_-_Modified_Store_tfdwxm.png"
/>

#### Connect Your Own Domain

At the top of the Theme section, you’ll notice a prompt to connect your own domain. Clicking on this will lead you to the Domains section of Settings where you can connect your domains and subdomains.

<img
  alt="Connect Your own Domain"
  classname="block dark:hidden"
  src="https://vendo-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_1920/q_auto/v1733327026/docs/Getting%20Started/1.13_Getting_Started_-_Connect_Your_own_Domain_ay8q1s.png"

/>

/>

Important: Whenever you make changes to the storefront, it’s important to publish them before backing out of the page builder otherwise all progress will be lost. To publish changes, click the blue button in the top right corner.

You can also preview changes you’ve made to the storefront without publishing them by clicking Preview in the top right corne.
