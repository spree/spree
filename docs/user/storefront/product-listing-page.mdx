Product Listing Pages (PLPs) display groups of products and help customers browse your catalog. In Spree, three types of pages act as PLPs and can be customized in the Theme Editor:

- **Shop All** - a standalone page showing your entire product catalog
- **Taxon pages** - one for each category, collection, or brand
- **Search Results** - dynamically shows products based on the customer’s search query

Each of these pages includes a product grid section that cannot be removed, ensuring a consistent product-browsing experience across your storefront. However, you can add additional sections to shape the layout and highlight promotions, brand messaging, or featured content.

## How to Edit Product Listing Pages

To edit a PLP, first go go to **Storefront → Themes** in the admin dashboard.

![Themes management tab in the Spree Commerce dashboard](/docs/images/user/storefront/themes/plp/1-storefront-themes.png)

Open your active theme, and use the page selector at the top left of the Theme Editor to choose Shop All, Taxon, or Search Results.

The preview and sidebar will update based on your selection.

### Edit the Shop All Page

![Edit the Shop All page in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/storefront/themes/plp/3-shop-all.png)

The Shop All page displays every product in your store and is fully customizable through the Theme Editor. There are two default sections:

#### Title Section

The Shop All page includes a title block at the top of the page body.

This block is editable and removable if you prefer a minimal layout or want to replace it with your own custom section.

#### Product Grid

The product grid list all of the items in your product catalog and is non-removable.

You can adjust its design settings (spacing, padding, etc.), but not delete it.

#### Adding Additional Sections

You can add page sections above or below the product grid to feature:

- Promotional banners
- Text and image blocks
- Custom content areas
- Seasonal messaging

For more information about adding page sections, please refer to our [<u>Theme Editor</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor) support article.

### Edit the Taxon Page

![Edit Taxon pages in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/storefront/themes/plp/4-taxon-pages.png)

Taxon pages display products belonging to a specific category, collection, or brand. Although each taxon has its own content (name, banner, products), the layout is shared across all taxon pages.

#### Taxon Banner

Each taxon page includes a non-removable banner section at the top.

It automatically displays:

- The **taxon name **and 
- The **taxon banner image**, if one is set in the admin dashboard
- The **singularized taxonomy name** above the taxon name (e.g., a taxon under _Categories_ will show _Category_)

This ensures consistent category presentation throughout your store.

#### Product Grid

The product grid displays all products within a given taxon, is non-removable, and appears below the taxon banner.

Its design settings can be adjusted, but the core functionality remains unchanged.

#### Adding Additional Sections

You can add sections to taxon pages, but with one important note: Any section you add will appear on every taxon page.

This is because all taxon pages share one layout in the Theme Editor.

Therefore, avoid adding content that is specific to a single category. Instead, focus on global elements such as:

- Category-specific promotional banners
- Universal messaging
- Brand-aligned visuals
- Featured content relevant only to some taxons

For more information about adding page sections, please refer to our [<u>Theme Editor</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor) support article.

### Edit the Search Results Page

![Edit the search results page in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/storefront/themes/plp/5-search-results-page.png)

The Search Results page displays products matching a customer’s search query.

#### Title Section

The page includes a default Search Results title block, which is both editable and removable.

You can customize the text or replace it with your own page sections.

#### Product Grid

The product grid displays all products that match the search query and is non-removable.

It automatically updates based on the user’s search term.

#### Adding Additional Sections

As with other PLPs, you can add additional sections to provide:

- Search-related messaging
- Banners to promote best sellers
- Helpful visual content
- Notices or suggestions

These additions apply only to the Search Results page.

For more information about adding page sections, please refer to our [<u>Theme Editor</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor) support article.

## Publishing Changes

After adjusting any PLP, make sure to click **Publish** in the top-right corner.

Your changes will appear immediately on the live storefront.

You can return to the Theme Editor at any time to update the layout.
