Blog posts are a powerful tool in ecommerce. They help drive organic traffic to your store via SEO, build trust with customers, and provide opportunities to promote products or share helpful content like tutorials, stories, or news.

In Spree, adding blog posts is fast and intuitive - no developer required.

## Add a New Post

To create a blog post, navigate to **Storefront → Posts** in the Spree admin dashboard.

## Post Content

This section includes the main content of your blog post.

- **Title** - The title of your blog post. This is shown on the storefront and used in the URL (slug).
- **Content** - The body of the blog post. Use the rich text editor to format text, add images, and embed videos.
- **Excerpt** - A short summary displayed on the storefront post preview and in meta tags if no meta description is set.

## Featured Image

## Post Details

This section defines important metadata for the post:

- **Author**- The admin user associated with the post. Defaults to the user creating the post.
- **Category** - Helps organize posts into high-level topics (e.g., News, Guides, Recipes).
- **Published At** - The date/time when the post should go live.
- **Tags** - Add keywords for better search filtering and to categorize posts further.

<Warning>If either **Author** or **Published At** is not set, the post will not appear on the storefront.</Warning>

## Search Engine Listing

Manage how the post appears in search engine results (all optional):

- **Meta Title** - defaults to the Title if left blank.
- **Meta Description** - defaults to the Excerpt if left blank.
- **Slug** - defaults to a URL-friendly version of the Title if left blank.

## Create the Post

Once all sections are filled out, click **Create** at the bottom of the page to finalize your new post.

Your post will now be published and visible on the storefront (if a Published At date is set). You can return to this section at any time to edit or delete the post.
