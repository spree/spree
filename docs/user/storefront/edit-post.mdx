At some point, you might want to edit a blog post after it’s published to ensure the information remains accurate and up-to-date. Additionally, updating the content can help improve SEO performance and keep it relevant for your audience.

To edit a post, navigate to the Posts tab of the admin dashboard found under Storefront.
