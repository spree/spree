Spree’s [<u>multi-store functionality</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/use-case/multi-store/capabilities) allows you to manage completely separate storefronts - each with its own branding, products, payment methods, and more - all from a single admin dashboard.

This is useful if you want to:
- Target different customer segments or regions
- Operate multiple brands or product lines
- Offer localized shopping experiences

## Add a New Store

![How to create a new store in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/storefront/create-new-store/1-add-new-store.png)

1. Click **\+** next to your store name in the top-left corner of the admin dashboard.
2. Select **New Store** from the dropdown.

This opens a panel where you can configure the new store.

### Required Settings

![Configuring new store settings in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/storefront/create-new-store/2-new-store-settings.png)

You’ll be asked to fill in the following:
- **Site Name** - the public-facing name of your store (used in social sharing and SEO)
- **Country** - the country this store will serve
- **Default locale** - the default language to be used on the store 
- **Currency** - the currency used at checkout
- **Import Products** - whether to import existing products from another store
- **Import Payment Methods** - whether to import payment methods from another store

<Note>Your choices should align with your business strategy. For example, if you're launching in a new region, you might use a different currency or pricing strategy but reuse your product catalog and payment setup.</Note>

Once ready, click **Create** to launch your new store. You’ll be automatically redirected to its admin panel.

## Switch Between Stores

To manage a different store, click the **store name** in the top-left corner and select the store you want to access.

## Cross-Store Data Sharing

When creating a new store, Spree gives you control over what data is shared and what remains separate.

### Shared with New Store
- **Products, Inventory & Locations** (can choose which apply to this store)
- **Customers**
- **Shipping Methods, Rates, Markets**
- **Payment Methods** (selectable per store)
- **Admin User Access**

### Not Shared with New Store
- Orders
- Shipments
- Payments
- Refunds
- Store Credits
- Gift Cards
- Blog Posts
- Themes & Pages
- Integrations (e.g., Google Analytics, Meta Pixel)
