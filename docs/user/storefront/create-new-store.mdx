If you plan to target different customer segments, regions, or markets, you might want to add another store to offer tailored products and experiences. 

The multi-store approach also allows you to manage separate brands or product lines while keeping centralized control over operations and analytics.

To add a new store, click the site name in top left corner to reveal a dropdown menu and click “+ New Store”.

There are five to be completed before creating the new store:

* Site Name - the name that’s displayed in social sharing links, search engines, and browser tabs

* Country - the country you’ll be selling to

* Currency - the currency you’ll be selling in

* Import Products - whether or not you’d like to import products from another store

* Import Payment Methods - whether or not you’d like to important payment methods from another store

Note: The country, currency, product imports, and payment methods you choose for your new store will depend on your specific use case and overall business model.

After configuring these settings, click the blue ‘Create’ button in the bottom right corner to create your new store. You will then be redirected to the store's admin panel.

Congratulations, you’ve just created another store!
