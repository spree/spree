A visually appealing and well-organized storefront is essential for any online business. It builds trust with customers and can significantly improve your conversion rates.

The Spree theme editor provides a powerful, no-code, drag-and-drop page builder that allows you to visually design your storefront, reflect your brand identity, and preview changes in real time - without writing a single line of code or hiring developers.

## How to Edit Your Theme

To edit your storefront’s theme, navigate to **Storefront → Themes** in the admin dashboard.
