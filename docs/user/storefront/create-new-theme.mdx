Spree Commerce supports multiple storefront themes, allowing you to design and manage your storefront visually - without writing code or disrupting your live site.

While only one theme can be live at a time, you can freely create, duplicate, and edit themes in the background, switching them live whenever you’re ready.

## Create a New Theme

Navigate to the **Storefront** tab in the admin dashboard to view your list of themes.

You have two options to create a new one:

### Clone an Existing Theme

If you want to build off an existing layout or design, click the three dots next to the theme you want to copy and select **Clone**.

The clone will appear in your list of themes as a Draft, ready to edit without impacting the live storefront.

### Start from a Template

Scroll to the bottom of the themes list and choose from one of the available starter templates.

Click **Add**, and the new theme will be added to your theme list as a Draft.

## Edit Your Theme

Simply click on any theme in **Draft** status to open the visual page builder. You can update layouts, change styling, and preview changes in real time.

Refer to the [<u>Theme Editor</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor) documentation for full details on editing themes.

## Publish a Theme

When you're ready to go live with a new theme:

- Click the **Publish** button next to the theme.
- The newly published theme will be marked as **Live**.
- The previously live theme will automatically revert to **Draft**.

<Note>Only one theme can be live at a time.</Note>
