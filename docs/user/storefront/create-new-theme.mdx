Spree open-source supports multiple storefront themes, giving you the flexibility to design and customize your eCommerce experience with no developers involved (no-code) and without disrupting your live store. 

While only one theme can be live at a time, you can seamlessly switch between themes with just a click. This allows you to experiment, update, or prepare new designs in the background.

## Create a New Theme

To create a new theme, navigate to the Storefront tab of the admin dashboard.

Here, you’ll find two options to create a new theme.

### Duplicate an Existing Theme

If you don’t want to create a new theme from scratch, you can create an exact copy of an existing theme by duplicating it.

To duplicate a theme, find the theme you’d like to copy, click the three dots on the right hand side, and select Duplicate.

The duplicate will be added to your list of themes and can now be updated and experimented with without affecting the live storefront.

### Add a New Theme

If you’d rather start with an empty template, then you can add a new theme by selecting one of the theme templates at the bottom of the page.

Simply click the blue “Add” button and the theme will be to your list of themes and can now be updated and experimented with without affecting the live storefront.

## Publish a Theme

Once you’re happy with the layout design of your new theme, you’ll probably want to publish it at some point.

You can publish a theme at any time by clicking the “Publish” button on the right hand side.

You’ll notice that the status of the theme you published will change to ‘Live’ and the previously live theme will change to ‘Draft’.

Note: Only one theme can be live at any given time.
