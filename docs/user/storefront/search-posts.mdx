Searching for blog posts in the backend allows you to quickly locate specific content for updates, edits, or review, saving time when managing multiple posts. It also helps you maintain organization by easily accessing posts based on titles, authors, or other criteria.

To search blog posts, navigate to the Posts tab of the admin dashboard found under Storefront.

Click on the ‘Filters’ button at the top of the list and to the right of the search bar. This will open the filters UI.

Here you’ll find three options to help refine your search for blog posts.:

* Title Link - filters results by post name or a term included in the name

* Author - filters results by the author of the post

* Category - filters results by the category the post belong to

Using these filters will make blog management much easier, especially if you have a large number of posts.
