# Delete a Landing Page

If a landing page is no longer needed, you can delete it directly from the Pages list to keep your admin area organized.

## Delete a Page

To delete a page, go to **Storefront → Pages** in the admin dashboard, and find the page you want to remove.

Click the **three-dot menu** on the right side of the page row.

Then simply select **Delete** and confirm the deletion when prompted.

The page will be removed immediately and will no longer appear on your storefront.
