Storefront settings like a favicon, preview image, custom head/body tags, and social media links ensure that your store has a cohesive and professional appearance. 

These elements enhance branding, improve user experience, and optimize how your store is displayed on social media and in search results.

To manage storefront settings, navigate to the Settings tab found under Storefront.

The page is subdivided into 5 distinct section. Let’s take a look at each separately in more detail.

## SEO

This is where you can manage SEO settings for your store. The three settings are as follows:

* Site Name - the name that’s displayed in social sharing links, search engines, and browser tabs

* Search Description - a short site description displayed in social sharing links and search engines

* Index In Search Engines - checking this box will allow your site to appear in search engines

Note: You might not want your site indexed in search engines if it’s still under development or undergoing significant updates, as unfinished content or errors could negatively impact your brand perception. 

Another scenario would be a member-only platform, in which case you might not want your site indexed to protect exclusive content and ensure that only authorized users can access the information. Preventing indexing helps maintain privacy and exclusivity, aligning with the platform's membership-based model.

Outside of scenarios such as these, you likely want to **make sure that this box is checked** when officially going live.

## Security

In the security section, you can choose to make your store password protected and set the password.

To set the password:

1. Check the ‘Password Protected’ box, 

2. Click ‘Update’ at the bottom of the page and the ‘Password’ field will appear

3. Set the password and click ‘Update’ again

Note:

A site might be password protected to restrict access during development, ensuring only authorized users can view and test it before it goes live. This is particularly useful for maintaining privacy and preventing unfinished or unpolished content from being publicly visible. 

Password protection is also ideal for member-only platforms or exclusive content, ensuring access is limited to those with the proper credentials.

## Custom Code

Adding custom code to the \<head> tag allows you to integrate scripts, styles, or metadata critical for SEO, analytics, or third-party tools. Placing code after the \<body> tag or before the \</body> tag enables you to add functionality such as tracking scripts or custom JavaScript without interfering with the primary content loading process.

Simply enter your code into the appropriate box and click ‘Update’ at the bottom of the page.

## Images

### Favicon Image

A favicon is a small image that appears in the tab of your web browser when you visit a website. It is usually a tiny square or rectangle with a unique design or logo that represents your website.

A favicon is important because it enhances your brand's recognition, making your site easily identifiable in browser tabs, bookmarks, and search results.

Simply upload your favicon image (rec. size 120x120px) and click ‘Update’ at the bottom of the page.

### Preview Image

The preview image will be used when your store is shared on social media or in search engines.

A preview image is important because it visually represents your site when shared on social media or in messaging apps, helping to attract clicks and reinforce your branding.

Simply upload your preview image (rec. size 120x120px) and click ‘Update’ at the bottom of the page.

## Social Media

You can add social links for the following platforms:

* Instagram

* Facebook

* Twitter

* Pinterest

* Tiktok

* Youtube

## Click Update

Once you’re finished configuring your storefront settings, make sure to click the blue ‘Update’ button at the bottom of the page, otherwise your changes will not be saved.

Congratulations, your store is now optimized for branding, user experience, and visibility!
