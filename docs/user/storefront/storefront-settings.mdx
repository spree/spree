Configure your store’s visual identity, search visibility, social presence, and custom code snippets with ease using Spree’s Storefront Settings.

These settings help you:

- Control search engine indexing and social sharing previews
- Add custom code for tracking or personalization
- Ensure a polished, professional storefront experience

To access storefront settings, go to **Settings → Storefront** in the admin dashboard.

Here you'll see several sections that allow you to configure key storefront settings related to SEO, branding, appearance, and more.

## SEO

![Storefront SEO settings in Spree Commerce](/docs/images/user/storefront/settings/2-seo-settings.png)

Control how your store appears in search engines and social media previews.

- **SEO Title** - Appears in social shares, browser tabs, and search results.
- **Meta Description** - A short summary of your store that shows up in search listings and social previews.
- **Index in Search Engines** - Toggle this to allow or prevent your store from being indexed.
  - You may want to disable indexing if:
    - Your site is still in development
    - You’re making major content/design changes
    - You run a member-only platform and want to restrict access
  - Otherwise, make sure indexing is enabled when going live.

## Security

To enable password protection:

1. Check the Password Protected box - this reveals the Password field

This is useful for stores in development or platforms offering exclusive, member-only access.

## Custom Code
