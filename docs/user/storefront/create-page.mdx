You can add custom pages to your store - such as an About Us page, a brand story page, or product-focused landing pages - without any developer assistance. These pages let you share additional content with your customers and highlight what matters most to your brand.

Although core pages like Product Details Pages (PDPs), Product Listing Pages (PLPs), and policy pages are generated automatically, Spree allows you to create as many additional pages as your store needs.

## Create a New Page

To create a new page, go to **Storefront → Pages** in the admin dashboard.

Click **Add New Page** in the top-right corner and enter a name for your new page in the form. 

<Note>Optional: Adjust the SEO settings before creating the page.</Note>

Click **Create** to finalize the creation of your new page and you'll be redirected to the [<u>Theme Editor</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor), where you can begin customizing its layout and content.

Once inside the Theme Editor, you can:

- Add, remove, and reorder page sections
- Insert images, text, banners, links, and more
- Adjust design settings
- Preview your changes in mobile and desktop views
- Click **Publish** when ready to save your changes

After you publish the page, it becomes immediately available on your live storefront. You can link to it in your navigation menu and other storefront sections, or use it in marketing campaigns.

For detailed instructions on working with the Theme Editor, please refer to our [<u>Theme Editor documentation</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor).
