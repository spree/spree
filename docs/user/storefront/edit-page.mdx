From time to time, you may find it necessary to update the products or information that's displayed on your custom pages, perhaps even the layout itself.

To edit a page, navigate to the Pages tab of the admin dashboard, found under Storefront.

Locate the page you’d like to edit and click on it. This will open up the Theme Editor for that specific page.

Here you can modify the page as you would with any other page in the Theme Editor as described in this support article: \{\{LINK TO THEME EDITOR}}

Important: Make sure to click ‘Publish’ once you’re done editing the page, otherwise any changes you’ve made will not be saved when you navigate away from the Theme Editor.

## Page Settings

In the top bar of the Theme Editor, you’ll notice the ‘Page Settings’ button.

Clicking on this will open up a window that allows you to change the page name, meta title and description, and the URL slug. There is also an option to delete the page.

Simply edit the information as required and click the blue ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the window.
