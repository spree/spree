# Edit a Landing Page

Learn how to edit custom landing pages in Spree Commerce.

You can easily update the content, layout, or product sections on your custom landing pages directly through the Theme Editor - no developer help required.

## Edit a Page

To edit a page, go to **Storefront → Pages** in the admin dashboard.

Find the page you want to edit and click on it and you’ll be taken to the [<u>Theme Editor</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor) for that specific page.

From here, you can update the page just like any other customizable page in the Theme Editor.

## Make Changes in the Theme Editor

Inside the Theme Editor, you can:

- Add, remove, or reorder page sections
- Update images, text, and other content
- Adjust design settings
- Preview your changes on mobile and desktop
- **Publish** your updates when ready

<Warning>Be sure to click **Publish** when you're finished, otherwise your changes will not be saved or published to the live site.</Warning>

For more information on how to work with the Theme Editor, please refer to our [<u>Theme Editor documentation</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/storefront/theme-editor).
