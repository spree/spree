Stock transfers allow you to move inventory between stock locations - a critical feature for multi-warehouse operations. This helps keep inventory balanced across your network, improves fulfillment speed, and reduces shipping costs by positioning products closer to customers.

<Note>
  Before you can create stock transfers, you must first set up additional stock locations.
  See: [<u>Settings → Locations</u>](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/user/settings/locations).

## How to Create a Stock Transfer

To create a new stock transfer, navigate to **Products → Stock → Stock Transfers**.

![](/docs/images/user/products/stock-transfers/1.stock_transfers_tab.png)

Click **New Stock Transfer** in the top-right corner, and you’ll be redirected to the stock transfer creation form.

Here you’ll see two distinct sections that allow you to:

## Configure Transfer Details

At the top of the form, you can specify the details of the stock transfer:

- **Origin Location**: Select the warehouse the stock will be transferred from
- **Destination Location**: Select the warehouse the stock will be transferred to
- **Reference (optional)**: Add a label or note to help identify the transfer (e.g., Q2 Restock - East Coast)

## Add Products to the Transfer

At the bottom of the form, you can add the products to be transferred.

To do so, click **\+ Add Products** and a search window will open, allowing you to start typing a product name to find matching variants.

Please select a variant and then click **Add selected variant** to add it to the stock transfer.

Now simply enter the number of units to be transferred for each variant.

<Note>
  You can only transfer quantities that are currently in stock at the origin location.

## Finalize the Transfer

When you're ready:

- Review the details
- Click **Create** to process the transfer

The inventory counts at each location will be updated immediately to reflect the transfer (assuming the physical movement of stock has already occurred) and a record of the transfer will be added to the Stock Transfers tab.
