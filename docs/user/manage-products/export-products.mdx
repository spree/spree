Exporting your product catalog can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as reviewing product data in bulk, backing up product information, or syncing catalog details with external systems like ERPs or reporting tools.

## How to Export Your Product Catalog

To export your product catalog, navigate to the **Products** tab of the admin dashboard.

Click on **Export** in the top right corner.

This opens a export modal that gives you two options to choose from:

- **Filtered Records**: Export only filtered records matching the search criteria
- **All**: Export all records (can be slow for large datasets)

<Warning>
  If you plan to export a subset of your product catalog, make sure to apply the appropriate filters before clicking **Export**.
</Warning>

Once you’ve made your selection, click **Export** in the modal, and a link to download the file will be sent to the email address associated with your user account.
