Below is a list of all the product fields that can be imported via CSV (required fields in bold).

For an example of **how to structure multi-variant products**, please download this [product import file template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/refs/heads/main/docs/downloads/product_import_file_template.csv).

<Note>You don’t need to follow the field naming conventions in this template exactly. Field names can be mapped manually during the import process.</Note>

<Warning>The **slug** field acts as the unique identifier for the product in Spree - no two products can share the same slug. When updating products via CSV import, the slug must exactly match an existing record to avoid creating duplicates.</Warning>
