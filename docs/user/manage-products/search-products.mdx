As your catalog grows, manually scrolling through the Products list becomes less practical. Fortunately, Spree’s search and filtering tools make it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for - whether it's a specific product, a group by status, or everything under a certain category.

## How to Search & Filter Products

To begin, go to the **Products** tab in the admin dashboard.

At the top of the page, you’ll find a search bar and a variety of filtering options to help narrow down results.

### Search

Use the search bar to quickly find products by name or keyword.

Results update automatically to match your query.

To clear the current search, click the **X** next to the query label below the search bar.

### Status & Stock Filters

The dropdown labeled **Show: All Products** allows you to filter by:

- **Status**: Active, Draft, or Archived
- **Stock availability**: Any stock, In Stock, or Out of Stock

You can apply one filter from each category at a time (e.g., Active and In Stock). The current filter selection will be reflected in the label.

## Additional Filters

### Taxons

Here, you can filter by category, collection, brand, or any other taxonomy you’ve defined (e.g., Categories → Men → Shoes or Collections → Spring).

Feel free to select multiple taxons from the dropdown, or select **Without taxon** to filter by products that haven’t been merchandised yet.

To learn more about organizing products into taxons, see **Taxonomies**.

### Tags

You can also filter products by one or more tags which can be helpful for merchandising or marketing workflows (e.g., Sale, New Arrival, Vegan).

<Note>
  Tags can be added in the product editor or via bulk actions.

### Vendors (Enterprise only)

If you're using Spree Enterprise, you can also filter products by vendor which is incredibly useful for managing multi-vendor catalogs.
