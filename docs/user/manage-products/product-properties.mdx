<Warning>
**Starting with Spree 5.2**, Metafields are the **recommended default** for storing custom product attributes, replacing the legacy [Product Properties](/developer/core-concepts/products#product-properties) system. For new projects, use [Metafields](/user/settings/metafields) instead of Properties.

Product Properties are still supported for backward compatibility (until Spree 6.0) but require enabling via `config.product_properties_enabled = true`. See the [upgrade guide](/developer/upgrades/5.1-to-5.2#3-migrate-to-metafields-or-keep-using-properties) for migration details.
</Warning>

Product properties provide detailed specifications, such as dimensions, materials, care instructions, allergen warnings, etc., that help customers make informed purchase decisions. 

They streamline inventory management by standardizing key product details across listings. Additionally, product properties enhance product listings by highlighting unique features that differentiate items from competitors.

To manage product Properties, navigate to the Properties tab of the admin dashboard found under Products.

![Spree Commerce product properties tab](/docs/images/user/products/properties/1-product-properties.png)

This page lists all of the product properties added to your store, with columns indicating the kind of property, how many products have the property, and the visibility of the property.

### Add a New Property

To add a new property, click **New Property** in the top right corner to open the product property creation page.

When creating a new property field, you’ll see the following form inputs:

- **Presentation** - the display name of the property shown on the storefront (if visible).
- **Internal Name** - a unique identifier used in the backend. If left blank, it will default to the Presentation name.
- **Kind** - defines the type of value this property stores:
  - **Short Text** - e.g., “Cotton”
  - **Long Text** - e.g., “Made from organically grown cotton harvested in Japan”
  - **Number** - e.g., “10”
  - **Rich Text** - supports formatted content (e.g. bold, lists)
- **Display** - Controls where the property is shown:
  - **Both admin panel & storefront** - useful for customers and admins alike
  - **Only on storefront** - e.g., material, country of origin
  - **Only on admin panel** - e.g., internal notes, restocking schedule

Once you’ve completed all of the fields, click the **Create** to save your new product property.

If a product is visible on the storefront, the property will appear (if it has a non-empty value) below the product description on PDPs as shown below:

### Properties Management

From the Properties tab, there are a number of ways in which you can edit product properties:

#### Properties Ordering

If you’d like to change the order in which properties are displayed on the storefront, e.g., on product detail pages, you can drag and drop them into position by clicking on the 6 dots on the left hand side.

#### Editing Properties

To edit a property, navigate to the Properties tab, and click **Edit** on the property you’d like to edit.

![Product edit form in Spree](/docs/images/user/products/properties/5-edit-properties.png)

Feel free to change the Presentation Name, Internal Name, Kind, and Display On fields.

Once you’re finished, make sure to click **Update** to save your changes.

### Delete Properties

To delete a property, click on the **three-dot menu** in the top right corner and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu, or simply click **Delete** in the bottom right corner.

### Import Properties

Properties can be automatically imported if you add the appropriate values to the properties columns in a product import file.
