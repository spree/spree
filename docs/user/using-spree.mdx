First, you'd need to decide which Spree edition is a good fit for your project:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Community Edition" href="https://github.com/spree/spree/">
    Spree Community Edition is free. It's the DIY version of Spree. It comes with community support only.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enterprise Edition" href="https://spreecommerce.org/enterprise/">
    Spree Enterprise Edition comes with more features, more security, more integrations and enterprise support.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

So what sets both versions apart? Here's a [feature comparison](https://spreecommerce.org/enterprise/) of the two editions and here's an [in-depth overview](https://spreecommerce.org/spree-commerce-version-comparison-community-edition-vs-enterprise-edition/).

To start using Spree, either version, the steps are usually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup">
    Setup your Spree application (backend and storefront)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize">
    Customize Spree to meet your business needs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go live!">
    Deploy to your preferred hosting/cloud provider
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Looking for Developer Documentation?

This Spree user documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Spree e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Spree store can be found here.

If you are a developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](/docs/developer) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.

BTW Give Spree a [GitHub Star](https://github.com/spree/spree)<Icon icon="star" iconType="solid" color="#FFD43B" />, why dont't ya?
