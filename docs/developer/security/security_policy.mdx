## Overview

Proper application design, intelligent programming, and secure infrastructure are all essential in creating a secure e-commerce store using any software (Spree included). The Spree team has done its best to provide you with the tools to create a secure and profitable web presence, but it is up to you to take these tools and put them in good practice. We highly recommend reading and understanding the [Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html).

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do not announce potential security vulnerabilities in public. We have a dedicated email address [security@spreecommerce.org](mailto:security@spreecommerce.org). We will work quickly to determine the severity of the issue and provide a fix for the appropriate versions. We will credit you with the discovery of this patch by naming you in a blog post.

If you would like to provide a patch yourself for the security issue **do not open a pull request for it**. Instead, create a commit on your fork of Spree and run this command:
