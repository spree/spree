title: "PCI Compliance"
---

All store owners wishing to process credit card transactions should be familiar with [PCI Compliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pci_compliance). All officially supported payment gateways — [Spree Stripe](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe), [Spree Adyen](https://github.com/spree/spree_adyen), and [Spree PayPal Checkout](https://github.com/spree/spree_paypal_checkout) — are fully PCI-compliant.

## Using payment tokens

We do not transmit or store Credit Card numbers. Instead we're using payment processor tokens supplied by their SDKs to authorize and charge customer cards. Sensitive payment data is collected directly by the gateway's frontend SDK (e.g., Stripe.js, Adyen Drop-in) and never touches your server.

## 3-D Secure and Strong Customer Authentication support

[Spree Stripe integration](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe) supports [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://stripe.com/en-pl/guides/strong-customer-authentication) out of the box. We also use Stripe JavaScript SDK to render all payment forms.

[Spree Adyen integration](https://github.com/spree/spree_adyen) supports 3D Secure 2.0 through the Adyen Drop-in component.
