title: "PCI Compliance"
---

All store owners wishing to process credit card transactions should be familiar with [PCI Compliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pci_compliance). [Spree Stripe](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe) and [Spree Braintree vzero](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero) are PCI-compliant.

## Using payment tokens

We do not transmit or store Credit Card numbers. Instead we're using payment processor tokens supplied by their SDKs to authorize and charge customer cards.

## 3-D Secure and Strong Customer Authentication support

[Spree Stripe integration](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe) supports [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://stripe.com/en-pl/guides/strong-customer-authentication) out of the box. We also use Stripe JavaScript SDK to render all payment forms.

[Spree Braintree vzero](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero) extension supports [3D Secure 2.0](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/3d-secure/overview).
