Spree is a very flexible platform allowing you to customize every part of it, to suit your business needs.

There are several ways you can achieve this:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store settings">
    There's a lot of Store settings you can change in the admin panel without touching the code.

    Changing currency, shipping zones, languages - it's very easy to do.

    Go to **Admin > Settings**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuration">
    Global application configuration allows you to tweak Spree's behavior without having to modify the source code.

    Please see [Preferences](/developer/customization/configuration) section for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication">
    Spree allows you to use your own authentication system.

    To do this, you need to create a new authentication system and configure Spree to use it.

    You can find more information in the [Authentication](authentication) section.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Checkout flow">
    With Spree you can change the checkout flow to fit your business needs.

    Please see [Checkout flow customization section](checkout) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dependencies">
    Spree allows you to swap core classes and services with your own, eg. you want to handle adding to cart differently.

    In your `config/initializers/spree.rb` file, you can set the following:

    ```ruby
    Spree::Dependencies.cart_add_item_service = "MyCartAddItemService"
    ```

    which would use `MyCartAddItemService` to handle adding to cart.

    You can find more information in the [Dependencies](dependencies) section.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Decorators">
     Decorators allow you to add behavior to Spree classes in your application. We're using a neat feature of Ruby language called [Module.prepend](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Module.html#method-i-prepend) to add the behavior to the model.

    For example, to add a method that returns the product name in uppercase, you would add the following to your decorator:

    ```ruby
    module Spree
      module ProductDecorator
        def custom_name
          name.upcase
        end
      end

      Product.prepend(ProductDecorator)
    end
    ```

    <Warning>
    Decorators should be used as a last resort. They can make upgrading Spree more difficult.
    </Warning>

    Please see [Decorators](decorators) section for more information.
