## Overview

In this guide we will show you how to create custom promotion rules and actions in Spree.

### Custom Promotion Actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Ensure proper directory structure">
    Ensure you have the following directory structure:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p app/models/spree/promotion/actions
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Create a new model file">
    Create a new file in `app/models/spree/promotion/actions/` directory
    ```bash
    touch app/models/spree/promotion/actions/my_promotion_action.rb
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Implement your own Logic">
    Implement your custom logic in the `perform` method.
    ```ruby
    module Spree
      module Promotion
        module Actions
          class MyPromotionAction < Spree::PromotionAction
            def perform(options={})
              # Implement your custom logic here
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    <Note>
      This class needs to inherit from `Spree::PromotionAction` model.
    </Note>
    <Info>
      You can access promotion information using the `promotion` method within any `Spree::PromotionAction`.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Register the New Action">
    Register the new action with Spree.
    Open `config/initializers/spree.rb` and add the following line:
    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
      Rails.application.config.spree.promotions.actions << Spree::Promotion::Actions::MyPromotionAction
    end
    ```
    Once this has been registered, it will be available within Spree's interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Add Translations for the Admin Dashboard">
    To provide translations for the interface, you will need to define them within your locale file. For instance, to define English translations for your new promotion action, use this code within `config/locales/en.yml`:

    ```yaml
      en:
        spree:
          promotion_action_types:
            my_promotion_action:
              name: My Promotion Action
              description: Performs my promotion action.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Restart Your Application">
    After making these changes, restart your application. Your custom promotion action will now be available within Spree's admin interface, ready for use in your promotions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Custom Promotion Rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Ensure proper directory structure">
    Ensure you have the following directory structure:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p app/models/spree/promotion/rules
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Create a new model file">
    Create a new file in `app/models/spree/promotion/rules/` directory:

    ```bash
    touch app/models/spree/promotion/rules/my_promotion_rule.rb
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Implement your own Logic">
    Implement your logic within this class as shown below:

    ```ruby
    module Spree
      class Promotion
        module Rules
          class MyPromotionRule < Spree::PromotionRule
            def applicable?(promotable)
              promotable.is_a?(Spree::Order)
            end

            def eligible?(order, options = {})
              # Your custom eligibility logic here
            end

            def actionable?(line_item)
              # Your custom actionability logic here
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    <Note>
      This class needs to inherit from `Spree::PromotionRule` model.
    </Note>
    
    <Note>
    The <code>eligible?</code> method should return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> to indicate if the promotion should be eligible for an order, based on your custom logic. Similarly, define <code>actionable?</code> to evaluate line items against your promotion criteria.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Register the Custom Rule">
    To make your custom rule available, register it within Spree by adding the following block to your `config/initializers/spree.rb` file:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
      Rails.application.config.spree.promotions.rules << Spree::Promotion::Rules::MyPromotionRule
    end
    ```
    
    This step ensures that your custom rule is recognized and can be utilized within the Spree ecosystem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Create Promotion Rule view template">

    Create a partial for your new rule:
    
    ```bash
    touch app/views/spree/admin/promotions/rules/_my_promotion_rule.html.erb
    ```
    
    This file can either be simple or complex based on whether your rule requires parameters for configuration.

    For guidance, refer to existing rule partials in Spree's backend sources to understand how to structure this file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Add Translations for the Admin Dashboard">
    To display your rule within the Spree admin interface, define its name and description in your locale files. For English, edit `config/locales/en.yml` and add:

    ```yaml
    en:
      spree:
        promotion_rule_types:
          my_promotion_rule:
            name: "My Promotion Rule"
            description: "Custom rule for my promotion"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="7. Restart Your Application">
    After making these changes, restart your application. Your custom promotion rule will now be available within Spree's admin interface, ready for use in your promotions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
