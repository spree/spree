## Spree Initializer

To change values for these preferences, you need to edit your `config/initializers/spree.rb` file.

For example, to disable the `expedited_exchanges` feature, you would add the following line:

```ruby
Spree.config do |config|
  config.expedited_exchanges = false
end
```

<Note>
  Remember to restart your Rails server after making changes to the `config/initializers/spree.rb` file.
</Note>

## Accessing Configuration

To access these preferences in your application, you can use the `Spree::Config` module. For example, to access the `expedited_exchanges` preference, you can do the following:

```ruby
Spree::Config.expedited_exchanges
```

This will return the current value of the `expedited_exchanges` preference. You can also set the value of a preference using the `Spree::Config` module. For example, to set the `expedited_exchanges` preference to `true`, you can do the following:

```ruby
Spree::Config.expedited_exchanges = true
```

This will set the `expedited_exchanges` preference to `true` for the current process. After restarting the Rails server, the preference will return to the default value or the one set in the initializer.
