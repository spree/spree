## Default configuration

By default Spree is mounted at the root of your domain, this code will be inserted into `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Spree::Core::Engine, at: '/'
```

This means that Spree will be available at the root of your domain, for example `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customizing the mount point

You can customize this simply by changing the `:at` specification in `config/routes.rb` to be something else. For example, if you would like Spree to be mounted at `/shop`, you can write this:

```ruby
mount Spree::Core::Engine, at: `/shop`
```

The different parts of Spree (API, Admin) will be mounted there as well, eg. `http://localhost:3000/shop/products`.
