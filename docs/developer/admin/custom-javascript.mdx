## Extending Admin Dashboard with JavaScript

Spree Admin Dashboard can be easily extended with custom JavaScript. Most of the JavaScript in the Admin Dashboard is powered by a framework called [Stimulus.js](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) which is the Ruby on Rails default. It's a very simple and minimalistic framework only enhancing our server-side rendered HTML with a bit of interactivity.

### 3rd party JavaScript libraries

Spree Admin Dashboard comes with a few 3rd party JavaScript libraries already included.

Main libraries we're using:

* [Stimulus.js](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)
* [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/)
* [EasyPick](https://easepick.com/) (date picker)
* [TomSelect](https://tom-select.js.org/) (autocomplete/dropdowns)
* [Sortable.js](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) - sortable drag and drop lists
* [Uppy](https://uppy.io/) - file uploader

You can find them in the [app/assets/javascripts/vendor](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/admin/vendor/javascript) directory.

### Managing JavaScript dependencies

You're probably wondering why these libraries are in the `vendor` directory, and not in `node_modules`.

That's because we're not using Node.js at all. So no Yarn or npm. We're using a different approach to manage dependencies.

We're using a tool called [Importmaps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails) to manage dependencies which is the Ruby on Rails default.

<Info>
If you want to use a different JavaScript package manager you can do so by using [jsbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) gem.

#### Install dependencies

To install dependencies you need to run the following command:

```bash
bin/rails importmap pin react
```

This will install the dependencies, download the files to your `vendor/javascript` directory and add them to your `config/importmap.rb` file, eg.

```ruby
pin "react" # @19.1.0
```

Now you can just import the library in your application entry point, eg. `application.js`:

```js
import "react";
```

### Application entry point

Mentioned above, the application entry point is the `application.js` file. It's located in the `app/javascript` directory.

If you want to add custom JavaScript to your Spree Admin Dashboard, you can do so by adding a new file to the `app/javascript` directory.

### Stimulus Controllers

Stimulus controllers are a way to add interactivity to your Spree Admin Dashboard. Admin Dashboard controllers can be found in the Spree repository in the [Admin Dashboard/app/javascript/spree/admin/controllers](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/admin/app/javascript/spree/admin/controllers) directory.

You can find more information about Stimulus controllers in the [Stimulus.js documentation](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/controllers).

To add a new controller you need to create a new file in the `app/javascript/controllers` directory. It will be automatically picked up by the application.

```js
// app/javascript/controllers/hello_controller.js
import { Controller } from '@hotwired/stimulus'

export default class extends Controller {
  connect() {
    console.log("Hello Spree Commerce Stimulus!", this.element);
  }
}
```

To use the controller in your HTML you need to add the `data-controller` attribute to your element, eg.

```html
<div data-controller="hello">
  Hello Spree Commerce Stimulus!
</div>
```

## JavaScript snippets

If you need to add a small piece of JavaScript code (eg. tracking, marketing, analytics, customer service etc.) you can do this by:

1. Declaring a new head partial in the `config/initializers/spree.rb` file, eg.

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.spree_admin.head_partials << 'spree/admin/shared/my_tracking_code'
    ```

2. Creating a new file in the `app/views/spree/admin/shared/my_tracking_code.html.erb`, where you can add your tracking code, eg.

    ```erb
    <script>
      console.log("I'm a spy!");
    </script>
    ```
