description: How to customize the Spree admin panel authentication
---

By default Spree uses the same model for the admin panel as the storefront. However you can customize it to use a different model.

Let's assume you have an existing `AdminUser` model in your application and you're using Devise for authentication.

In `config/initializers/spree.rb` file, add the following line:

```ruby
Spree.admin_user_class = 'AdminUser'
```

This will tell Spree to use your `AdminUser` model for the admin panel. You will also need to add the following line in that model file:

```ruby
include Spree::UserMethods
```

In your `config/initializers/routes.rb` file, you will need define devise routes for the 2nd model:

```ruby
Spree::Core::Engine.routes.prepend_routes do
  # Admin authentication
  devise_for(
    Spree.admin_user_class.model_name.singular_route_key,
    class_name: Spree.admin_user_class.to_s,
    controllers: {
      sessions: 'spree/admin/user_sessions',
      passwords: 'spree/admin/user_passwords'
    },
    skip: :registrations,
    path: :admin_user,
    router_name: :spree
  )
end
```

And now in your `lib/spree/authentication_helpers.rb` file, please replace the following lines: 

```diff
     def spree_admin_login_path(opts = {})
-      spree_login_path(opts)
+      new_admin_user_session_path(opts)
     end

     def spree_admin_logout_path(opts = {})
-      spree_logout_path(opts)
+      destroy_admin_user_session_path(opts)
     end
```

Now when attempting to access the admin panel, you will be redirected to the dedicated admin panel login page.
