Spree Admin Dashboard stylesheet system is built in top [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor to compile custom stylesheets. To be precise we're using DART-SASS (so you don't need to install Node.js).

You can find the stylesheets files in [app/assets/stylesheets/spree/admin](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/admin/app/assets/stylesheets/spree/admin) directory.

The main entry point file is [application.scss](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/admin/app/assets/stylesheets/spree/admin/application.scss) which uses SASS `@import` directive to include other stylesheets.

## Adding custom CSS

Besides SASS you can still include standard CSS files. To do so:


1. Create a new file in your application `app/assets/stylesheets` directory:

    ```bash
    touch app/assets/stylesheets/custom_spree_admin.css
    ```
2. Add some CSS rules to the file:

    ```css
    .custom-class {
      color: red;
    }
    ```
3. Create a template file in your application `app/views/spree/admin/shared` directory:

    ```bash
    touch app/views/spree/admin/shared/custom_spree_admin_stylesheets.html.erb
    ```

4. Use standard Ruby on Rails [stylesheet_link_tag](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.2/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html#method-i-stylesheet_link_tag)

    ```erb
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'custom_spree_admin' %>
    ```

5. Register this template in the Spree initializer (`config/initializers/spree.rb`):

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.spree_admin.head_partials << 'spree/admin/shared/custom_spree_admin_stylesheets'
    ```

That's it! Now you're custom CSS code will be included after loading the standard Admin stylesheets.
