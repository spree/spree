## Overview

Admin Dashboard utilizes [Spree's authorization system](/developer/customization/permissions) to control access to the different pages.

## Restricting access to certain pages

Let's assume you would like to add a new Role `customer_service` with some limited access to Admin Panel only Orders section.

Create a new file called `app/models/customer_service_ability.rb`

```ruby
class CustomerServiceAbility
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    if user.respond_to?(:has_spree_role?) && user.has_spree_role?('customer_service')
      can :manage, Spree::Order
    end
  end
end
```

Please familiarize yourself with [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) syntax to understand `can/cannot` methods more.

Now we need to inform Spree to use this ability, create another file `app/models/spree/ability_decorator.rb` with contents:

```ruby
module Spree
  module AbilityDecorator
    def abilities_to_register
      [CustomerServiceAbility]
    end
  end

  Ability.prepend(AbilityDecorator)
end
```

This will automatically remove all other pages/navigation items from the sidebar for the `customer_service` role.

You can be even more granular with the permissions by using the `can` method.

```ruby
can :manage, Spree::Order
can :read, Spree::Product
can :update, Spree::Product
```

This will restrict the access to the `customer_service` role to only the Orders and Products pages. However they won't be able to delete products or add new ones, just update existing ones.
