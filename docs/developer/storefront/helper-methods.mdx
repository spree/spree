## `current_currency`

Returns the currently selected currency. By default in the Storefront this will be `store.default_currency`. This can be changed in the `Settings -> Store Defaults` page.

```erb
<%= current_currency %>
```

will return

```
USD
```

## `current_locale`

Returns the currently selected locale. By default in the Storefront this will be `store.default_locale`. This can be changed in the `Settings -> Store Defaults` page. If there are multiple locales available, it will return the locale that is currently selected by the user.

```erb
<%= current_locale %>
```

<Info>
  Locale also affects the storefront URLs. For example, if the default locale is `en` and the user selects `fr`, the URL will be `/fr/products/123`.
