## `current_currency`

Returns the currently selected currency. By default in the Storefront this will be `store.default_currency`. This can be changed in the `Settings -> Store Defaults` page.
<%= current_currency %>
```

will return

```
USD
```

## `current_store`

Returns the current store [Spree::Store](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/core/app/models/spree/store.rb) instance.

```erb
<%= current_store.name %>
```

## `local_time`

Displays a time in the user's timezone in a human readable format (based on the browser's timezone).

```erb
<%= local_time(order.sent_to_erp_at) %>
```

Provided by [local_time gem](https://github.com/basecamp/local_time).

## `supported_currencies`

Returns the list of supported currencies for the current store as an array of strings.

```erb
<%= supported_currencies %>
```

will return

```ruby
["USD", "EUR"]
```

## `try_spree_current_user`

Returns the current user object (class depends on the `Spree.admin_user_class` configuration). If the user is not signed in, it will return `nil`.

```erb
<%= try_spree_current_user.email %>
```

If you want to check if the user is signed in, you can use the following:

```erb
<%= try_spree_current_user.present? %>
```
