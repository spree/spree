Spree 5 ships with a new mobile-first storefront that is fully customizable & themeable.

## Architecture

Spree Storefront consists of:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Themes" href="/developer/storefront/themes">
    Themes are a collection of styles, scripts and templates that are used to style and layout the storefront.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pages" href="/developer/storefront/pages">
    Pages are the main building blocks of the storefront. They are used to create the structure of the storefront. Each Theme comes with a set of default pages such as Home Page, Product Listing Page, Product Page, etc, but you can create your own custom landing pages as well.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sections" href="/developer/storefront/sections">
    Sections are the building blocks of the pages. They are used to create the structure of the pages. Each Section is a collection of Blocks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blocks" href="/developer/storefront/blocks">
    Blocks are the smallest building blocks of the storefront. They are used to create the content of the pages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Links" href="/developer/storefront/links">
    Links are used to create the navigation of the storefront. They can be assigned to Sections and Blocks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Page Builder

The new storefront comes with a visual Page Builder that allows non-developers to build pages using a drag-and-drop interface, as a part of Spree Admin Dashboard (provided via `spree_admin` gem). This allows your team to create new pages and sections, modify existing ones, and add new blocks to the pages in a no-code way.
