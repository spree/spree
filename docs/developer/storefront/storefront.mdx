Rails Storefront is a mobile-first storefront that is fully customizable & themeable.

### Tech Stack

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Responsive, mobile-first design
- [Turbo / Hotwire](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) — Fast, SPA-like navigation
- [StimulusJS](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) — JavaScript controllers for interactivity
- [Importmaps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails) - NodeJS not required

### Installation

You can install it by running

  ```bash
  bundle add spree_storefront
  ```

Then run the install generator:

  ```bash
  bin/rails g spree:storefront:install
  ```

This will set up the storefront views, Tailwind CSS configuration, and page builder migrations.

You will also need to create your first theme:

  ```bash
  Spree::Store.default.send(:create_default_theme)
  ```

### Architecture

Rails Storefront consists of:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Themes" href="/developer/storefront/themes">
    Themes are a collection of styles, scripts and templates that are used to style and layout the storefront.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pages" href="/developer/storefront/pages">
    Pages are the main building blocks of the storefront. They are used to create the structure of the storefront. Each Theme comes with a set of default pages such as Home Page, Product Listing Page, Product Page, etc, but you can create your own custom landing pages as well.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sections" href="/developer/storefront/sections">
    Sections are the building blocks of the pages. They are used to create the structure of the pages. Each Section is a collection of Blocks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blocks" href="/developer/storefront/blocks">
    Blocks are the smallest building blocks of the storefront. They are used to create the content of the pages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Links" href="/developer/storefront/links">
    Links are used to create the navigation of the storefront. They can be assigned to Sections and Blocks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Page Builder

The storefront comes with a visual Page Builder that allows non-developers to build pages using a drag-and-drop interface. This allows your team to create new pages and sections, modify existing ones, and add new blocks to the pages in a no-code way.
