## Page Builder

The new storefront comes with a visual Page Builder that allows non-developers to build pages using a drag-and-drop interface, as a part of Spree Admin Dashboard (provided via `spree_admin` gem). This allows your team to create new pages and sections, modify existing ones, and add new blocks to the pages in a no-code way.

You can learn more about the Page Builder in the [User Documentation](/user/storefront/theme-editor).
