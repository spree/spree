<Warning>Documentation on blocks is coming soon</Warning>

Blocks are the lowest level of components in Spree Storefront. They are nested inside sections.

Similarly to sections each block can be customized in terms of its content, styles, and layout.

Every block has a set of default preferences, such as:

* `text_alignment`
* `container_alignment`
* `size`
* `width_desktop`
* `top_padding`
* `bottom_padding`
