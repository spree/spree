The [Spree Next.js Storefront](https://github.com/spree/nextjs-starter-spree) is a production-ready, headless e-commerce storefront built with Next.js 16, React 19, and the Spree Commerce API v3.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** - App Router, Server Actions, Turbopack
- **React 19** - Server Components
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript 5** - Full type safety
- **[@spree/sdk](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/packages/sdk)** - Official Spree Commerce SDK
- **[@spree/next](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/packages/next)** - Server actions, caching, and cookie-based auth
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring

## Features

- **Server-First Architecture** - All API calls happen server-side, API keys never exposed to the browser
- **Secure Authentication** - JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- **Product Catalog** - Browse, search, and filter with faceted navigation
- **Shopping Cart** - Server-side state management
- **Multi-Step Checkout** - Guest and signed-in users, multi-shipments, coupon codes, gift cards, store credit
- **Stripe Payments** - Credit Cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Klarna, Affirm, SEPA and more via [Spree Stripe](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe)
- **Google Tag Manager** and **GA4 Ecommerce** event tracking
- **Customer Account** - Profile, order history, address book, gift cards, saved payment methods
- **Multi-Region** - Country and currency switching via URL segments
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running Spree Commerce 5.4+ instance

## Installation

### Option 1: Fork the Starter (Recommended)

Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nextjs-starter-spree.git
cd nextjs-starter-spree
npm install
```

This gives you a full copy you can customize freely while still being able to pull upstream updates.

### Option 2: Clone Directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spree/nextjs-starter-spree.git
cd nextjs-starter-spree
npm install
```

## Configuration

Copy the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Update `.env.local` with your Spree API credentials:

```env
SPREE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
SPREE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_api_key_here
```

<Note>
  These are server-side only variables — no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix needed since all API calls happen in Server Actions.
</Note>

See [Deployment](/developer/storefront/nextjs/deployment) for all optional environment variables (Sentry, GTM, etc.).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

See the [Deployment](/developer/storefront/nextjs/deployment) guide for Vercel, Docker, and other hosting options.
