## Built-in Pages

Spree Storefront comes with a full set of built-in pages that you can customize via page builder.

| Page | Description | Class | URL |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Home | The main landing page of your store | [Spree::Pages::Homepage](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/homepage.rb) | `/` |
| Product Details | Individual product display page | [Spree::Pages::ProductDetails](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/product_details.rb) | `/products/:id` |
| Taxon | Shows products filtered by taxon | [Spree::Pages::Taxon](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/taxon.rb) | `/t/:permalink` |
| Search Results | Displays search results for products | [Spree::Pages::SearchResults](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/search_results.rb) | `/search` |
| Shop All | Shows all products | [Spree::Pages::ShopAll](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/shop_all.rb) | `/products` |
| Blog | Shows your store's blog posts and articles | [Spree::Pages::PostList](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/post_list.rb) | `/posts` |
| Post | Individual blog post | [Spree::Pages::Post](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/post.rb) | `/posts/:permalink` |
| Password | Password page, when password protected storefront is enabled | [Spree::Pages::Password](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/password.rb) | `/` |

All of these page can be fully customized via page builder. You can add/remove sections, etc.

We're planning to add page builder support for the following pages in the next Spree releases:

- Cart
- Checkout
- Account

## Sections

Each page is made of [sections](/developer/storefront/sections). Sections are the building blocks of a page. They are used to create the page content.

You can fetch page sections using:

```ruby
current_page.sections
```

## Custom Landing Pages in the Admin

You can easily create your own landing pages by going to to the `Admin -> Storefront -> Pages` and clicking on the `New Page` button. More on this in the [Create a Landing Page](/user/storefront/create-page) guide. Each custom landing page can be customized via page builder.

Under the hood they use [Spree::Pages::Custom](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/pages/custom.rb) class.

## Building a new Page from scratch

If you need to build a page that is not one of the built-in pages, you can create your own page class. This will allow you to create a dedicated page for your business needs and at the same time allow your non-technical team to manage the page content without bugging you :)

Let's assume you need to create a page that displays pickup locations. You already created a new model `Spree::PickupLocation` and added some data to the database. Now you want to create a page that displays these pickup locations.

First, let's add a route for the new page.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Spree::Core::Engine.add_routes do
  scope '(:locale)', locale: /#{Spree.available_locales.join('|')}/, defaults: { locale: nil } do # this line will enable translations for the new page
    resources :pickup_locations, only: [:index]
  end
end
```

Now, create the new page class file:

```bash
mkdir -p app/models/spree/pages && touch app/models/spree/pages/pickup_locations.rb
```

Now, let's add the new page class:

```ruby
module Spree
  module Pages
    class PickupLocations < Spree::Page
      # use https://tabler.io/icons to find the icon name
      def icon_name
        'map-marker-alt'
      end

      # This method is used to determine if the page is customizable via page builder
      def customizable?
        true
      end

      # this is the URL used to preview the page in the page builder UI
      def page_builder_url
        return unless page_builder_url_exists?(:pickup_locations_path)

        Spree::Core::Engine.routes.url_helpers.pickup_locations_path
      end

      # this is the default sections that will be shown on the page
      # in the later guide for sections you will learn how to add custom sections
      def default_sections
        [
          Spree::PageSections::PageTitle.new
        ]
      end
    end
  end
end
```

You will need to register the new page in the `config/initializers/spree.rb` file:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Rails.application.config.spree.pages << Spree::Pages::PickupLocations
end
```

Now, the controller:

```bash
mkdir -p app/controllers/spree && touch app/controllers/spree/pickup_locations_controller.rb
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/spree/pickup_locations_controller.rb
module Spree
  class PickupLocationsController < StoreController
    def index
      @current_page = current_theme.pages.find_by(type: 'Spree::Pages::PickupLocations') # this is very important, without this the page will not be found
      @pickup_locations = current_store.pickup_locations
    end
  end
end
```

Lastly we need to add a view file for the page:

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/spree/pickup_locations && touch app/views/spree/pickup_locations/index.html.erb
```

And add the following code to the view file:

```erb
<%= render_page(current_page, pickup_locations: @pickup_locations) %>
```

`render_page` is a helper method defined in the [Spree::PageHelper](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/storefront/app/helpers/spree/page_helper.rb) module that renders the page. It fetches all page sections and renders them one by one in the order they are set in the page builder by store staff.

Passing `pickup_locations` variable to the `render_page` method allows you to use it in the page sections templates, eg.

```erb
<%= pickup_locations.each do |pickup_location| %>
  <%= pickup_location.name %>
<% end %>
```
