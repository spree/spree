This guide walks you through creating a complete Spree feature from scratch, covering models, Admin dashboard, API and Storefront. 
By the end, you'll understand how to add new manageable features to the Spree platform.

## Overview

Building a Spree feature in Spree typically involves:

1. Creating a database model
2. Creating admin UI (index, new, edit, form)
3. Adding API endpoints
4. Adding Storefront (optional)
5. Writing tests

## Example: Building a Brand Resource

Let's create a complete "Brand" resource that allows admins to manage [Product](/developer/core-concepts/products) brands.

## Step 1: Create the Migration

Create a new model migration file:

```bash
bin/rails g migration CreateSpreeBrands name:string:index slug:string:uniq active:boolean:index position:integer:index
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Step 2: Create the Model

Create the model file at `app/models/spree/brand.rb`:

```bash
mkdir -p app/models/spree && touch app/models/spree/brand.rb
```

Add the following code to the file:

```ruby
module Spree
  class Brand < Spree::Base
    # FriendlyId for nice URLs, eg. https://example.com/brands/nike-sportswear
    extend FriendlyId
    friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: %i[slugged history]

    # Include metadata support
    include Spree::Metafields

    # Active Storage attachments
    has_one_attached :logo

    # Action text for rich text content
    has_rich_text :description

    # Validations
    validates :name, presence: true
    validates :slug, presence: true, uniqueness: true

    # Associations
    has_many :products, class_name: 'Spree::Product', dependent: :nullify

    # Scopes
    scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
    scope :alphabetical, -> { order(:name) }
    scope :with_logo, -> { includes(:logo_attachment).where.not(logo_attachment: { blob: nil }) }
  end
end
```

**Key points:**
- This is a standard Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord model
- Inherit from `Spree::Base` (not `ApplicationRecord`) to automatically inherit all Spree functionality
- Always specify `class_name` and `dependent` in associations
- Use string columns instead of enums
- Use `FriendlyId` for nice URLs
- Include `Spree::Metafields` for [Metafields](/developer/core-concepts/metafields) support
- Use Rails Active Storage for file attachments
