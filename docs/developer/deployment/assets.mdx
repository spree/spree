Spree uses [Active Storage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) to handle file uploads (eg. product images). By default, Active Storage uses local disk storage for attachments. This isn't suitable for production environments.

For production environments, we recommend using a cloud storage service such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/).

## AWS S3

To use Amazon S3 as your storage service, you need to configure the storage in the `config/storage.yml` file.

```yaml
amazon:
  service: S3
  access_key_id: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:aws, :access_key_id) %>
  secret_access_key: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:aws, :secret_access_key) %>
  region: "" # e.g. 'us-east-1'
  bucket: your_own_bucket-<%= Rails.env %>
```

You will also need to add the `aws-sdk-s3` gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem "aws-sdk-s3", require: false
```

And run `bundle install`.

Now you need to switch the storage service in your `config/environments/production.rb` file.

```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :amazon
```

Now you will need to grab the credentials from your AWS S3 bucket and add them to rails credentials by running the following command:

```bash
EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

Add the following credentials:

```yaml
aws:
  access_key_id: <your_access_key_id>
  secret_access_key: <your_secret_access_key>
  region: <your_region>
  bucket: <your_bucket>
```

Save and exit the editor. Remember to commit the changes to your repository.

### CORS Configuration

Spree Admin Dashboard uses direct uploads to handle file uploads. For this to work properly, you need to configure CORS on your S3 bucket.

1. Go to your S3 bucket in AWS Console
2. Click on "Permissions" tab
3. Scroll down to "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)"
4. Click "Edit" and paste the following configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://myspreestore.com"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
  }
]
```

<Info>
`myspreestore.com` should be replaced with your domain name which you access your Spree Admin Dashboard.

## Cloudflare R2

Cloudflare R2 is an S3-compatible, zero egress-fee, object storage with a built-in CDN. We strongly recommend using it as your storage service.

To use Cloudflare R2 as your storage service, you need to configure the storage in the `config/storage.yml` file.

```yaml
cloudflare:
  service: S3
  endpoint: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:cloudflare, :endpoint) %>
  access_key_id: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:cloudflare, :access_key_id) %>
  secret_access_key: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:cloudflare, :secret_access_key) %>
  region: auto
  bucket: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:cloudflare, :bucket) %>
```

You will also need to add the `aws-sdk-s3` gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem "aws-sdk-s3", require: false
```

And run `bundle install`.

Now you need to switch the storage service in your `config/environments/production.rb` file.

```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :cloudflare
```

Now you will need to grab the credentials from your Cloudflare R2 bucket and add them to rails credentials by running the following command:

```bash
EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

Add the following credentials:

```yaml
cloudflare:
  endpoint: <your_endpoint>
  access_key_id: <your_access_key_id>
  secret_access_key: <your_secret_access_key>
  bucket: <your_bucket>
```

Save and exit the editor. Remember to commit the changes to your repository.

### CORS Configuration

Spree Admin Dashboard uses direct uploads to handle file uploads. For this to work properly, you need to configure CORS on your R2 bucket.

1. Go to your R2 bucket in Cloudflare Console
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "CORS policy"
4. Click "Edit CORS policy" and paste the following configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://myspreestore.com"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "PUT"
    ],
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "Origin",
      "Content-Type",
      "Content-MD5",
      "Content-Disposition"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

<Info>
`myspreestore.com` should be replaced with your domain name which you access your Spree Admin Dashboard.
