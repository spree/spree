description: Learn how to build a Docker image of your Spree application.
---

Spree (when using Spree Starter template) comes with a Dockerfile that can be used to build a Docker image of your application.

You can find the Dockerfile in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter/blob/main/Dockerfile) file in the root of the project or in the Spree Starter repository.

This Dockerfile is pre-configured to run Spree with PostgreSQL database. That's the only external dependency you need to have installed on your machine to be able to run Spree.

You can later use that image to run your application in a containerized environment eg. AWS ECS, AWS Fargate, Azure Container Instances, etc.

## Building the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t spree .
```

## Running the Docker container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 spree
```

You can also run the container with a specific environment variable by using `-e` flag.

```bash
docker run -e RAILS_ENV=production spree
```

### Environment variables

You can set environment variables by using `-e` flag when running the container.

```bash
docker run -e RAILS_ENV=production -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY=... -e DATABASE_URL=... spree
```

You will need to set the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAILS_ENV` | Rails environment (production, development, test) | `production` |
| `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` | This should be the contents of your `config/master.key` file | `2fad5c0b79d25e4765d3018d8c740f8c3a665f0e5c...` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database URL, this could be your AWS RDS instance or any other PostgreSQL instance | `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/spree` |

There are also some other environment variables that you can set to customize your Spree application.

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` | Web server (Puma) threads | `3` |
| `PORT` | Web server port | `3000` |
| `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level, you can switch it to `debug` to see more detailed logs | `info` |
| `DEVISE_SESSION_TIMEOUT` | Session timeout in days | `14` |
