description: Learn how to send transactional emails from your Spree application.

Spree uses [ActionMailer](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html) to send transactional emails (eg. order confirmation, password reset, etc.) under the hood. You can use any SMTP server to send emails from your application. For production use we recommend using a service like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

## Configuring SendGrid

Spree Starter comes with SendGrid pre-configured out of the box and you will need to set the following environment variables:

* `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Your SendGrid API key. Can be found in the [SendGrid dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).
* `SENDGRID_DOMAIN` - The domain you want to use for sending emails that was verified in SendGrid, eg. `mystore.com`.

If you're not using Spree Starter you will need to add these code in your `config/environments/production.rb` file:

```ruby
  if ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'].present?
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      user_name: 'apikey', # This is the string literal 'apikey', NOT the ID of your API key
      password: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'], # This is the secret sendgrid API key which was issued during API key creation
      domain: ENV.fetch('SENDGRID_DOMAIN', Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host]),
      address: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
      port: 587,
      authentication: :plain,
      enable_starttls_auto: true
    }
  end
```

<Warning>
Remember to verify the email address in SendGrid, you intend to use for sending emails, otherwise emails will be rejected.

</Warning>

That's it! You can now send emails from your application.
