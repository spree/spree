description: Deploy your Spree application to [Render.com](https://render.com) Platform as a Service platform
---

## Overview

Render is a Platform as a Service that makes deploying and hosting Spree applications super easy.

Spree Starter is pre-configured to work with Render out of the box. It includes [render.yaml](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter/blob/main/render.yaml) file that is used to deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

- [Render account](https://render.com) - you will also need to add a credit card to your Render account to be able to deploy the application.
- [GitHub account](https://github.com)

## Setup repository

Firstly create your own repository based on Spree Starter template.

Go to [Spree Starter repository](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter) and click on "Use this template" button and select "Create a new repository".

Supply the repository name and click on "Create repository from template" button.

<Warning>
Make sure to set your repository visibility to "Private" so no one can see your code. This is crucial for your application security.
</Warning>

Now clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_spree_app.git
```

Now you can start working on your application. Make sure your environment is set up correctly (follow the [Getting Started](/developer/getting_started) guide).

Running the `bin/setup` script should set your credentials correctly.

![Setup credentials](/images/developer/deployment/setup_credentials.png)

<Warning>
Don't loose your `config/master.key` file or share it with anyone. It's crucial for your application to work. We recommend to add it to 1password or other password manager.
</Warning>

Now add your `config/credentials.yml.enc` file to the repository.

```bash
git add config/credentials.yml.enc
```

Commit the changes.

```bash
git commit -m "Add credentials"
git push
```

This file is encrypted and cannot be seen by anyone without the `master.key` file.

<Warning>
Don't commit your `master.key` file to the repository!
</Warning>

<Info>
You can learn more about credentials in the [Ruby on Rails Security Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials).
</Info>

## Create Render account and connect your repository

Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create an account. We recommend to use your GitHub account to sign up as it will automatically link your GitHub repositories to Render.

## Create Render blueprint

[Render blueprints](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) are YAML files used to deploy your application to Render. They consist a list of services that are required to run your application.

In the Render dashboard select "New blueprint" from the "+New" button.

Now select your repository from the list of repositories.

![Render select repository](/images/developer/deployment/render_select_repo.png)

You should see the the new blueprint form.

![Render services](/images/developer/deployment/render_deploy_blueprint.png)

1. Set your blueprint name - eg. `Spree App`
2. Copy your `config/master.key` file to the clipboard.

    ```bash
    cat config/master.key | pbcopy
    ```

3. Paste it to the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable.

After that is done click the "Deploy Blueprint" button. Now wait a few minutes for Render to setup your application.

You should see the following screen with the list of created services.

![Render deploy blueprint](/images/developer/deployment/render_created_services.png)

That's it! Your application is now deployed to Render.

You can now access the admin dashboard of your application at the following URL.

```url
https://<your-application-name>.onrender.com/admin
```

The default credentials are:

```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: password
```

<Warning>
We recommend changing credentials after logging in! You can also do it from the Rails console. In your Render dashboard select your `web` service and click on the "Shell" tab.

<img src="/images/developer/deployment/render_shell.png" width="200" />

Now you can open the Rails console by running `bin/rails console`.

```ruby
Spree::User.first.update!(email: "<your@email.com>", password: "<your_password>", password_confirmation: "<your_password>")
```
</Warning>

<Info>
Render will automatically any new changes you push to your repository.
</Info>

## Next steps

Now that your application is deployed, you also need to setup asset storage as Render only provides ephemeral storage.

- [Setup Asset storage](/developer/deployment/assets) (Amazon S3/Cloudflare R2)

Before going to full production, we recommend to also:

- [Setup CDN](/developer/deployment/cdn)
- [Configure Caching](/developer/deployment/caching)
