# Heroku

## Overview

Heroku is a Platform as a Service that makes deploying and hosting Spree applications super easy.

You should just follow [Heroku Rails 6 guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails6).

We recommend you start and stick to Heroku if you do not have DevOps-skilled team members. [Spree Starter](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter) is pre-configured to work with Heroku out of the box.

## Dynos

[Heroku Dynos](https://www.heroku.com/dynos) are lightweight, isolated environments that provide compute and run your application.

There are 2 types of dynos:

* **Web** - for running the web interface of yuour Store Storefront, API, Admin Panel
* **Worker** - for running background jobs via [Active Job](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) such as email send out, report generation, etc
