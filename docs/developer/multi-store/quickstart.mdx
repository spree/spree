## Store resources

Each Store can have its own resources. For example, a Store can have its own Products, Taxonomies, Promotions, etc.

| Resource                                          | Relationship                                                                                                                               |

| **Store Credit**                                  | One Store Credit belongs to and can be used in one Store

## Current Store

Spree will try to determine the current store based on the current URL. If the URL does not match any of the stores in the database, Spree will fall back to the default store.

All Spree controllers or any other controllers that include [Spree::Core::ControllerHelpers::Store](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/lib/spree/core/controller_helpers/store.rb) have access to the `current_store` method which returns the `Store` matching the current URL.

All parts of Spree (API, Admin Panel) have this implemented.

<Info>
Under the hood `current_store` calls [Spree::Stores::FindCurrent.new(url: url).execute](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/finders/spree/stores/find_current.rb).

This logic can be easily overwritten by setting 

```ruby
Spree::Dependencies.current_store_finder = 'MyStoreFinderClass'
```

in `config/initializers/spree.rb` file
</Info>

## Default Store

If the system cannot find any Store that matches the current URL it will fall back to the Default Store.

You can set the default Store via Rails console:

```ruby
Spree::Store.find(2).update(default: true)
```

To get the default store in your code or rails console type:

```ruby
Spree::Store.default
```

## Custom Domains

Spree supports managing custom domains for Stores. In the Admin Panel, you can manage custom domains for each Store in the **Settings -> Domains** page.

## Setup multi-store application
