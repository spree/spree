## Root domain

You need to set a wildcard `root_domain` on the store to enable multi-store setup

```ruby
Spree.root_domain = ENV.fetch('SPREE_ROOT_DOMAIN', 'lvh.me')
```

This will be used to generate the store URLs, eg. `store1.lvh.me`, `store2.lvh.me`, etc.

`store1` part is the unique store `code` identifier, which is auto-generated based on the store name. You can change it in the admin panel in **Settings -> Domains**.

<Info>
  If you later change the `root_domain`, you will need to run:

  ```ruby
  Spree::Store.all.each(&:save)
  ```
  
  to update the store URLs.

## Creating new stores

After you restart your application, you will see a new option in the admin panel, under new item menu:

![](/images/new_store_dropdown.png)

You can also create a new store from the rails console:

```ruby
Spree::Store.create!(name: 'New Store')
```

This will create a new store with the given name, code and URL.
