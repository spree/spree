### Update your Rails version to 5.1

Spree 3.3 requires Rails 5.1 at a minimum. Please follow the [official Rails guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-5-0-to-rails-5-1) to upgrade your application.

### Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rake railties:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### Include `UserMethods` in your `User` class

With this release, we're not including this automatically. You need to do it manually if you're not using `spree_auth_devise`.

You need to include `Spree::UserMethods` in your user class, eg.

```ruby
class User
  include UserAddress
  include UserMethods
  include UserPaymentSource
end
```

### Update `aws-sdk` gem to `>= 2.0`

Spree 3.3 comes with paperclip 5.1 support so if you're using Amazon S3 storage you need to change in your Gemfile, from:

```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk', '< 2.0'
```

to:

```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk', '>= 2.0'
```

and run `bundle update aws-sdk`

In your paperclip configuration, you also need to specify `s3_region` attribute eg. [https://github.com/spree/spree/blame/master/guides/content/developer/customization/s3_storage.md\#L27](https://github.com/spree/spree/blame/master/guides/content/developer/customization/s3_storage#L27)

See also [RubyThursday episode](https://rubythursday.com/episodes/ruby-snack-27-upgrade-paperclip-and-aws-sdk-in-prep-for-rails-5) walkthrough of upgrading paperclip in your project.

### Add jquery.validate to your project if you've used it directly from Spree

If your application.js file includes line `//= require jquery.validate/jquery.validate.min` you will need to add this file manually to your project because this library was [removed from Spree in favor of native HTML5 validation](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/8173).
