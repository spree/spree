title: 2.3 to 2.4
section: upgrades
description: 'This guide covers upgrading a 2.3 Spree store, to a 2.4 store.'
---

This guide has been written from the perspective of a blank Spree 2.3 store with no extensions.

If you have extensions that your store depends on, you will need to manually verify that each of those extensions works within your 2.4 store once this upgrade is complete. Typically, extensions that are compatible with this version of Spree will have a 2-4-stable branch.

## Upgrade Rails

For this Spree release, you will need to upgrade your Rails version to at least 4.1.8.

```ruby
gem 'rails', '~> 4.1.8'
```

## Upgrade Spree

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 2.4'
```

Run `bundle update spree`.

## Copy and run migrations

Copy over the migrations from Spree (and any other engine) and run them using
these commands:

```bash
rake railties:install:migrations
```

```bash
rake db:migrate
```
