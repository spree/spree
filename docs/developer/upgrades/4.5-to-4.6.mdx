title: 4.5 to 4.6
description: This guide covers upgrading a 4.5 Spree application to Spree 4.6.
---

<Warning>
We recommend [upgrading straight to 4.8](4.x-to-4.8), as we improved how we handle translations in 4.8.
This also means easier database migration, especially if you have a big product catalog.
</Warning>

<Note>
If you're on an older version than 4.5 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally, e.g.

1. [upgrade 4.2 to 4.3](4.2-to-4.3)
2. [upgrade 4.3 to 4.4](4.3-to-4.4)
3. [upgrade 4.4 to 4.5](4.4-to-4.5)
</Note>

## Update gems

Run the following command to update your gems to 4.6:

```bash
bundle update
```

## (Optional) Remove spree_globalize

If your application used the spree_globalize extension, you can remove it from your Gemfile, as translations are now supported out-of-the-box with the [Mobility](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility) gem.

We've configured Mobility to use [a strategy that uses a separate table to store translations](https://dejimata.com/2017/3/3/translating-with-mobility#strategy-2), just like how spree_globalize did. This means, you won't need to make any changes to the database structure or migrate data.

During the upgrade process, you may need to review your custom queries that rely on translations, as there are minor differences in how Mobility handles them. Spree 4.6 includes a few [built-in concerns](/developer/core-concepts/i18n#resource-translations-implementation) to make it easier to work with translatable models.

Run the following command to remove spree_globalize from your Gemfile:

```bash
bundle remove spree_globalize
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
bin/rake spree:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

<Note>
If you didn't use `spree_globalize` before, this will install migrations that move some columns from `spree_products`, `spree_taxons`, to dedicated translation tables such as `spree_products_translations`, `spree_taxons_translations` etc.

If you're using raw SQL queries (either in the application code, or running in external tools), you may need to review the new structure and update your queries accordingly.
</Note>

### Run install generators

This will copy some files from `spree_backend` to your application.

```bash
bin/rails g spree:backend:install
```

If you're using `spree_frontend` you need to run the frontend install generator as well:

```bash
bin/rails g spree:frontend:install
```

## Additional fixes and hints

### Update migrations for translation tables with additional columns

If you want to translate more fields in [translated resources](/developer/core-concepts/i18n#resource-translations), you have to alter copied migrations or add new ones.
We're using the [Spree::TranslationMigrations](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/lib/spree/translation_migrations.rb) to help with migrating data.

### Add or update the behavior of the translated model

Each translated resource has a corresponding `Translation` model, see [here](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/v4.6.5/core/app/models/spree/product.rb#L44) for reference.
If you want to add some more behavior to the translation, you need to do it within the `Translation.class_eval` block.

If you overwrote Spree models in your application, you have to define this block yourself. Apart from that, please include these modules: 
- `Spree::TranslatableResource` - required for all translated models
- `Spree::TranslatableResourceSlug` - required for translated models with slugs/permalinks

[Read more](/developer/core-concepts/i18n#resource-translations-implementation) how Spree handles resource translations.

### Generating slugs with `friendly_id`

Generating slugs/permalinks in `Spree::Product` and `Spree::Taxon` models is now based on the translated name. If you use the `history` plugin, [read on how to use it](https://github.com/shioyama/friendly_id-mobility?tab=readme-ov-file#slug-history) with the `mobility` gem.

### Resource translations and encryption

Currently, it's not possible to translate encrypted data. If you're already encrypting data that Spree translates, you need to remove that functionality.

### Full text search with pg_search scopes

If you use the [pg_search](https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search) for the full text search in [translated resources](/developer/core-concepts/i18n#resource-translations), you need to move your scopes to the translated model, eg. from the `Spree::Product` to the `Spree::Product::Translation`. 

If you still want to have the original scope, you need to rewrite it, from:

```ruby
pg_search_scope :search_by_name, against: :name
```

to:

```ruby
self::Translation.class_eval do
  include PgSearch::Model
  pg_search_scope :search_by_name, against: :name
end

scope :search_by_name, lambda { |query|
  product_ids = Spree::Product::Translation.search_by_name(query).pluck(:spree_product_id)
  where(id: product_ids)
}
```
