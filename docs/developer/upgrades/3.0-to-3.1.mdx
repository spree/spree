---

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

## Copy and run migrations

Copy over the migrations from Spree and any other engine and run them using these commands:

```bash
rake railties:install:migrations
rake db:migrate
```

## Additional information

### Make sure to v1 namespace custom rabl templates & overrides.

If your rabl templates reference others with extend you'll need to add the v1 namespace.

For example:

```ruby
extends 'spree/api/zones/show'
```

Becomes:

```ruby
extends 'spree/api/v1/zones/show'
```

### Remove `Spree::Config.check_for_spree_alerts`

If you were disabling the alert checks you'll now want to remove this preference from `config/initializers/spree.rb` as it's no longer used.
