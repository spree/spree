title: 4.6 to 4.7
description: This guide covers upgrading a 4.6 Spree application to Spree 4.7.
---

<Warning>
We recommend [upgrading straight to 4.8](4.x-to-4.8), as we improved how we handle translations in 4.8.
This also means easier database migration, especially if you have a big product catalog.
</Warning>

<Note>
If you're on an older version than 4.6 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally

1. [upgrade 4.3 to 4.4](4.3-to-4.4)
2. [upgrade 4.4 to 4.5](4.4-to-4.5)
3. [upgrade 4.5 to 4.6](4.5-to-4.6)
</Note>
