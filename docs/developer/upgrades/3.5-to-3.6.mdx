## Update your Rails version to 5.2

Spree 3.6 requires Rails 5.2 at a minimum. Please follow the [official Rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/5_2_release_notes.html#upgrading-to-rails-5-2) to upgrade your application.

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

### (Optional) Migrate to ActiveStorage (optional)

Please follow the [official paperclip guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/blob/master/MIGRATING) if you want to use ActiveStorage instead of paperclip.

You can still use paperclip for attachment management by setting `SPREE_USE_PAPERCLIP` environment variable to `true`, but keep in mind that paperclip is DEPRECATED and we will remove paperclip support in Spree 4.0.

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rake railties:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

You're good to go!
