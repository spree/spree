# 4.3 to 4.4

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out through [Spree slack channels](http://slack.spreecommerce.org/)

**If you're on an older version than 4.3 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally**, eg.

1. [upgrade 4.0 to 4.1](four-dot-oh-to-four-dot-one.md)
2. [upgrade 4.1 to 4.2](four-dot-one-to-four-dot-two.md)
3. [upgrade 4.2 to 4.3](fout-dot-two-to-four-dot-three.md)

This is the safest and recommended method.

## Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '>= 4.4.0.rc1'
```

## Remove gems merged into Spree Core

### (Optional) Remove Spree Digital

If you used that gem in the past you need to remove it. Digital products are now incorporated into Spree core and you cannot use that gem anymore.

1. Remove `spree_digital` from your `Gemfile`

### (Optional) Remove Spree Wishlist

If you used that gem in the past you need to remove it. Wishlists are now incorporated into Spree core and you cannot use that gem anymore.

1. Remove `spree_wishlist` from your `Gemfile`
2. (Optional) Remove `//= require spree/frontend/spree_wishlist` from `vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/frontend/all.js`
3. (Optional) Remove `*= require spree/frontend/spree_wishlist` from `vendor/assets/stylesheets/spree/frontend/all.css`

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
bin/rake railties:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Update Spree Dashboard (`spree_backend`)

### Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree_backend', '>= 4.4.0.rc1'
```

### Update gems

```shell
bundle update
```

### Install `jsbundling-rails` gem

`spree_backend` 4.4 uses [Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus)](https://hotwired.dev/) and requires some javascript bundling provided by the excellent [jsbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) gem developed by the Rails core team.

This requires that you have both Node and yarn installed on your system.

```bash
bin/rails javascript:install:esbuild
```

### Install `@spree/dashboard` NPM package

JavaScript required by the `spree_backend` gem is distributed as [a NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spree/dashboard).

```
bin/rails g spree:backend:install
```

From now on when you run your app locally you need to use `bin/dev` instead of `bin/rails s`.

### Make sure that Node is available in your cloud environment

On Heroku, you need to add the node buildpack - [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#using-multiple-buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#using-multiple-buildpacks)

## Additional fixes and hints

### Add ActiveJob queues

Spree uses ActiveJob for processing long running operations to not interrupt your web server performance. You need to update your `config/sidekiq.yml` file if you're using the Sidekiq gem.

Make sure that `spree_stock_location_stock_items` and `spree_webhooks` queues are there. You can check [spree\_starter's config](https://github.com/spree/spree\_starter/blob/main/config/sidekiq.yml) as a guideline.

### Disabling webhooks

Spree 4.4 introduces webhook events for most of the Spree resources (Products, Orders, Customers, etc). If you wish to disable this globally you can set the environment variable:

```
DISABLE_SPREE_WEBHOOKS=true
```

If you would like to disable firing webhooks for certain elements of your application you can wrap these methods in a block:

```
Spree::Webhooks.disable_webhooks do
  ... run your code here ...
end
```

Webhooks do not fire on touch events. Webhooks also do not do anything until there is a first webhook subscriber created which can be done in the Admin Dashboard or via Platform API.

### Update Spree SDK

To use the new features such as Wishlists and Digital Products in your storefront please update [Spree SDK](https://github.com/spree/spree-storefront-api-v2-js-sdk) to [v4.12](https://github.com/spree/spree-storefront-api-v2-js-sdk/releases/tag/v4.12.0) at least.&#x20;

### Update Spree Dependencies that was renamed

Please change in your codebase:

```ruby
Spree::Dependencies.account_update_address_service
```

to

```ruby
Spree::Dependencies.address_update_service
```
