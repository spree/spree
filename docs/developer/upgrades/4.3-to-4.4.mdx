title: 4.3 to 4.4
description: This guide covers upgrading a 4.3 Spree application to Spree 4.4.
---

<Note>
If you're on an older version than 4.3 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally, eg.

1. [upgrade 4.0 to 4.1](4.0-to-4.1)
2. [upgrade 4.1 to 4.2](4.1-to-4.2)
3. [upgrade 4.2 to 4.3](4.2-to-4.3)
</Note>

## Update Gems

Run the following command to update your gems to 4.4:

```bash
bundle update
```

to install the new gems.

## Remove gems merged into Spree Core

These gems were merged into Spree Core in version 4.4. All of their functionality is now included in the `spree` gem so you can remove them.

### (Optional) Remove Spree Digital

If you used that gem in the past you need to remove it. Digital products are now incorporated into Spree core and you cannot use that gem anymore.

1. Remove `spree_digital` from your `Gemfile`

### (Optional) Remove Spree Wishlist

If you used that gem in the past you need to remove it. Wishlists are now incorporated into Spree core and you cannot use that gem anymore.

1. Remove `spree_wishlist` from your `Gemfile`
2. (Optional) Remove `//= require spree/frontend/spree_wishlist` from `vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/frontend/all.js`
3. (Optional) Remove `*= require spree/frontend/spree_wishlist` from `vendor/assets/stylesheets/spree/frontend/all.css`

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
bin/rake spree:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Run install generators

This will copy some files from `spree_backend` to your application.

```bash
bin/rails g spree:backend:install
```

If you're using `spree_frontend` you need to run the frontend install generator as well:

```bash
bin/rails g spree:frontend:install
```

## Additional fixes and hints

### Make sure that Node is available in your cloud environment

On Heroku, you need to add the node buildpack - [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#using-multiple-buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#using-multiple-buildpacks)

### Add Spree ActiveJob queues to your Sidekiq config

Spree uses ActiveJob for processing long running operations to not interrupt your web server performance.

If you're using [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) you need to update your `config/sidekiq.yml` file and 2 new queues:

* `spree_stock_location_stock_items`
* `spree_webhooks`

### Disabling webhooks

Spree 4.4 introduces webhook events for most of the Spree resources (Products, Orders, Customers, etc). If you wish to disable this globally you can set the environment variable:

```bash
DISABLE_SPREE_WEBHOOKS=true
```

If you would like to disable firing webhooks for certain elements of your application you can wrap these methods in a block:

```ruby
Spree::Webhooks.disable_webhooks do
  ... run your code here ...
end
```

Webhooks do not fire on touch events. Webhooks also do not do anything until there is a first webhook subscriber created which can be done in the Admin Dashboard or via Platform API.

### Update Spree Dependencies that was renamed

Please change in your codebase:

```ruby
Spree::Dependencies.account_update_address_service
```

to

```ruby
Spree::Dependencies.address_update_service
```
