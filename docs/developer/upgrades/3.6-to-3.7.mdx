## Update gems

Run

```bash
bundle update
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
rake railties:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Migrate Taxon icons to Spree Assets

We renamed `TaxonIcon` to `TaxonImage` to clarify usage of this model. If you were using `TaxonIcon` please run this to migrate your icons to images:

```bash
rails db:migrate_taxon_icons_to_images
```

## Ensure all Orders associated to Store

Orders needs to be associated to Stores. To ensure all existing `Order` are associated with `Store` please run this:

```bash
rails db:associate_orders_with_store
```

This will associate all Orders without Store to the default Store. This can take some time depending on your volume of data.

## Ensure all Orders have currency present

To enhance multi currency capabilities we've made `currency` presence obligatory in `Order` model. To ensure all existing `Orders` have `currency` present please run this command:

```bash
rails db:ensure_order_currency_presence
```

This will set `currency` in Orders without currency set to `Spree::Config[:default_currency]` value. This can take some time depending on your volume of data.

## Replace `guest_token` with `token` in your codebase

`Order#guest_token` was renamed to `Order#token` in order to unify the experience for guest checkouts and orders placed by signed in users.
