title: 2.2 to 2.3
description: 'This guide covers upgrading a 2.2 Spree store, to a 2.3 store.'
---

## Overview

This guide has been written from the perspective of a blank Spree 2.2 store with no extensions.

If you have extensions that your store depends on, you will need to manually verify that each of those extensions works within your 2.3 store once this upgrade is complete. Typically, extensions that are compatible with this version of Spree will have a 2-3-stable branch.

This is the first Spree release that supports Rails 4.1.

## Upgrade Rails

For this Spree release, you will need to upgrade your Rails version to at least 4.1.2.

```ruby
gem 'rails', '~> 4.1.2'
```

## Upgrade Spree

For best results, use the 2-3-stable branch from GitHub:

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 2.3'
```

Run `bundle update spree`.

## Copy and run migrations

Copy over the migrations from Spree (and any other engine) and run them using
these commands:

```bash
    rake railties:install:migrations
    rake db:migrate
```
