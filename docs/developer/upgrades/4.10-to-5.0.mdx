## Upgrade steps

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Remove old frontend/backend Spree gems">

    ```bash
    bundle remove spree_auth_devise spree_backend spree_frontend
    ```
    <Warning>
      Remove any code referencing `Spree::Backend`, `Spree::Fronted` or `Spree::Auth` from your application, especially from `config/initializers/spree.rb`.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Update main Spree gem">

    ```bash
    bundle update spree
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Install and run missing migrations">

    ```bash
    bin/rake spree:install:migrations && bin/rails db:migrate
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Add new Spree gems">

    ```bash
    bundle add spree_storefront spree_admin spree_stripe
    ```

    And run the following generators:

    ```bash
    bin/rails g spree:storefront:install
    bin/rails g spree:admin:install
    bin/rails g spree_stripe:install
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Migrate from Spree Auth Devise gem">
    If you previously used the `spree_auth_devise` gem, you will need to run some commands to create User and connect it to Spree. We don't use the `spree_auth_devise` gem anymore to allow you more control over the authentication and access to all Devise options directly in your application.

    First, install Devise and run the Devise generator:

    ```bash
    bundle add devise
    bin/rails g devise:install
    ```

    Create `Spree::User` model:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p app/models/spree && touch app/models/spree/user.rb
    ```

    Add the following code to your `Spree::User` model:

    ```ruby
    module Spree
      class User < ApplicationRecord
        devise :database_authenticatable # if you want to use the database_authenticatable feature
        devise :recoverable # if you want to use the recoverable feature
        devise :registerable # if you want to use the registerable feature
        devise :confirmable # if you want to use the confirmable feature
        devise :validatable # if you want to use the validatable feature

        devise :rememberable, :trackable, :encryptable, encryptor: 'authlogic_sha512'

        acts_as_paranoid
      end
    end
    ```

    In you `config/initializers/spree.rb` file, add the following code:

    ```ruby
    Spree.user_class = "Spree::User"
    ```

    Now run the new authentication generator to connect your `Spree::User` model to Spree:

    ```bash
    bin/rails g spree:authentication:devise
    ```

    And if you're using the default spree storefront, please run the following generator:

    ```bash
    bin/rails g spree:storefront:devise
    ```

    This will add devise routes and create controllers for the storefront.

    And that's it! You can now login to the admin panel and storefront using your existing users.
