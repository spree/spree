<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Update gems">

    ```bash
    bundle update
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Install and run missing migrations">

    ```bash
    bin/rake spree:install:migrations && bin/rails db:migrate
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. (Optional) Install importmap-rails gem">
    We've switched to using [importmap-rails](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails) for asset management. If you're using the `spree_backend` or `spree_frontend` gem, you'll need to install the `importmap-rails` gem.

    ```bash
    bundle add importmap-rails
    ```

    and run generators:

    ```bash
    bin/rails importmap:install && bin/rails turbo:install && bin/rails stimulus:install
    ```

    You can also remove the `jsbundling-rails` gem from your `Gemfile`:

    ```bash
    bundle remove jsbundling-rails
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. (Optional) Apply fix when upgrading from 4.5/4.6/4.7">
    If you're upgrading from 4.5/4.6/4.7, you need to set this configuration in your `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

    ```ruby
    Spree::RuntimeConfig.always_use_translations = true
    ```
  </Accordion>
