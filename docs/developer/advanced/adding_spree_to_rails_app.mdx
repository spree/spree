title: Adding to an existing Rails app
description: This guide will show you how to add Spree to an existing Ruby on Rails application.

<Warning>
  This guide is aimed at advanced users who want to add Spree to an existing Rails application. If you are new to Spree, please follow the [Quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart).
</Warning>

## Overview

If you already have a Ruby on Rails application, you can add Spree to it by following these steps.

<Info>
  Spree works with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** — whatever database your Rails app already uses. No database migration is needed.
</Info>

## 1. Add Spree gems

Add these lines to your project `Gemfile`:

```ruby
spree_opts = { 'github': 'spree/spree', 'branch': 'main' }
gem 'spree', spree_opts # core, API, and CLI
gem 'spree_admin', spree_opts # Admin panel (optional)
gem 'spree_storefront', spree_opts # Storefront (optional)
gem 'spree_emails', spree_opts # transactional emails (optional)
gem 'spree_sample', spree_opts # dummy data like products, taxons, etc (optional)
```

And run the following command to install the gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

## 2. Run the install generators

Spree uses a modular installation approach. First install the core, then add optional components.

### Install core Spree

This installs core models, API, CLI, and authentication:

```bash
bin/rails g spree:install --user_class=Spree::User --authentication=devise
```

**Core installation options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `user_class` | The class for your users, eg. `Spree::User` or `User` |
| `admin_user_class` | The class for admin users (defaults to `user_class`) |
| `authentication` | Authentication gem: `devise` or `custom` |
| `migrate` | Whether to run migrations (default: true) |
| `seed` | Whether to run the seed file (default: true) |
| `sample` | Whether to add sample data (default: false) |
| `admin_email` | Email of the first admin user |
| `admin_password` | Password of the first admin user |

### Install Admin Panel (optional)

```bash
bin/rails g spree:admin:install
bin/rails g spree:admin:devise  # if using Devise authentication
```

### Install Storefront (optional)

```bash
bin/rails g spree:storefront:install
bin/rails g spree:storefront:devise  # if using Devise authentication
```

## 3. Add sample data (optional)

To add sample data to your store, run:

```bash
bin/rake spree_sample:load
```

This will add some products, categories, and will setup a checkout flow to your store.

## 4. Exploring Your Store

Feel free to explore your store. You can do so because Spree comes with a default pre-built Storefront and Admin Panel.

### Logging into the Admin Dashboard

Use your browser window to navigate to [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin). You can log in with the default credentials:
  - login: `spree@example.com`
  - password: `spree123`

Upon successful authentication, you should see the admin screen:

Feel free to explore some of the Admin Panel features that Spree has to offer and to verify that your installation is working properly.

### Browsing Storefront

Spree comes with a default pre-built Storefront. You can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can later customize this Storefront or choose another one if you prefer Next.js or Vue.js.
