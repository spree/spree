Spree is built on top of [Ruby on Rails framework](https://rubyonrails.org) and handful of other libraries. Spree itself is a modular platform consisting of several modules (Ruby gems).

As many Rails applications Spree requires a relational database to run. Spree supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL. You can also use SQLite.

### Core gems

<Info>
These gems are the core of Spree and they are the most important part of the Spree platform. They are the building blocks that make Spree possible.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core">
    The core module is the heart of Spree, containing the essential components and functionalities that power Spree stores. This includes the models, services, and the backend logic necessary to manage products, orders, payments, shipping, and more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API">
    The API module provides a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) programmable interface to Spree, allowing developers to interact with the Spree store programmatically. This is useful for integrating Spree with other systems, building mobile applications, or customizing the frontend of a Spree store.

    API gem also includes Webhooks which are a way to let Spree know when something happens in the store. For example, when an order is placed, the API gem can send a webhook to a 3rd party service to let them know about the order.

  <Accordion title="Emails">
    The Emails module handles all aspects of email generation and delivery in Spree. This includes order confirmation emails, shipping notifications, promotional emails, and any other email communications between a Spree store and its customers.

    You can opt-out of the default email functionality and use a 3rd party email service eg. Klaviyo or [Mailchimp](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_mailchimp_ecommerce).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gateway">
    The Gateway module in Spree is responsible for handling payment processing. It integrates with various payment gateways and providers, allowing Spree stores to accept payments from customers through different methods and channels. This module ensures secure and efficient transaction processing, supporting a wide range of payment options to cater to diverse customer preferences.

### 3rd party Extensions

Extensions are Spree plugins that add new features or functionality to a Spree store. They are developed and maintained by the Spree community.

You can find a list of Spree extensions on the [Extensions list page](/developer/extending-spree/3rd-party-extensions)
