### Code Conventions

Spree is built on top of [Ruby on Rails framework](https://rubyonrails.org) and follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. As an example let's look at the Product model.

* the model itself is located in [app/models/spree/product.rb](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/product.rb) and is named `Spree::Product`
* the controller is located in [app/controllers/spree/products_controller.rb](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/storefront/app/controllers/spree/products_controller.rb) and is named `Spree::ProductsController`
* views for that controller are located in [app/views/spree/products](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/storefront/app/views/spree/products) directory

<Info>
All Spree code is prefixed with `Spree` namespace. Thanks to this convention, it's easy to identify Spree code in a Rails application and we will not have any conflicts with your application code or other libraries.
