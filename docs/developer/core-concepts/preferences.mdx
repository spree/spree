## Runtime Preferences

Runtime preferences are used as a configuration object for your application. They are stored in memory. The main use case is for application-wide preferences. For example, `Spree::Config.track_inventory_levels` is a runtime preference. All Spree preferences are defined in [core/lib/spree/core/configuration.rb](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/lib/spree/core/configuration.rb).

### Spree Configuration

Here is a list of all the runtime preferences that are available in Spree.

 | Configuration Key                  | Description                                                                                           | Default Value       |
      |------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
      | `allow_checkout_on_gateway_error`  | Continues the checkout process even if the payment gateway error failed.                             | `false`             |

      | `alternative_shipping_phone`       | Determines if an alternative phone number should be present for the shipping address on the checkout page. | `false`         |

      | `always_include_confirm_step`      | Determines if the confirmation step is always included in the checkout process, regardless of the payment method. | `false`             |
      | `auto_capture`                     | Depending on whether or not Spree is configured to "auto capture" the credit card, either a purchase or an authorize operation will be performed on the card (via the current credit card gateway). | `false` |
      | `auto_capture_on_dispatch`         | Captures payment for each shipment in Shipment#after_ship callback, and makes Shipment.ready when payment authorized. | `false` |

      | `credit_to_new_allocation`         | Determines if a new allocation is created anytime store credit is added. If not set, it will update the store credit's amount in place. | `false`             |

      | `disable_store_presence_validation` | Determines if Store presence validation for Products and Payment Methods is disabled. | `false`             |
      | `expedited_exchanges`               | Determines if an exchange shipment is kicked off upon return authorization save. Requires payment profiles to be supported on your gateway and a configured delayed job handler. | `false`             |
      | `expedited_exchanges_days_window`   | The number of days the customer has to return their item after the expedited exchange is shipped to avoid being charged. | `14`                |
      | `restock_inventory`                 | Determines if inventory should be restocked when an order is canceled or returned                              | `true`              |
      | `return_eligibility_number_of_days` | The number of days after purchase within which a return can be initiated. | `365` |
      | `send_core_emails`                  | Determines if core emails should be sent. This includes order confirmation and shipment tracking emails. | `true`             |

      | `track_inventory_levels`           | Determines if inventory levels should be tracked when products are purchased at checkout. This option causes new `InventoryUnit` objects to be created when a product is bought. | `true` |

### Spree Initializer

To change values for these preferences, you need to edit your `config/initializers/spree.rb` file.

For example, to disable the `expedited_exchanges` feature, you would add the following line:

```ruby
Spree.config do |config|
  config.expedited_exchanges = false
end
```

<Note>
  Remember to restart your Rails server after changing these values.
</Note>

### Accessing Configuration

To access these preferences in your application, you can use the `Spree::Config` module. For example, to access the `expedited_exchanges` preference, you can do the following:

```ruby
Spree::Config.expedited_exchanges
```

This will return the current value of the `expedited_exchanges` preference. You can also set the value of a preference using the `Spree::Config` module. For example, to set the `expedited_exchanges` preference to `true`, you can do the following:

```ruby
Spree::Config.expedited_exchanges = true
```

This will set the `expedited_exchanges` preference to `true` for the current process. After restarting the Rails server, the preference will return to the default value or the one set in the initializer.

## Model Preferences

Model preferences are used to store preferences for a specific model instance. They are stored in the database. The main use case is for user-specific preferences. For example, `user.preferred_language` is a model preference.

### Defining Model Preferences

To define a model preference, you need to add them to your model class.

Firstly generate a migration to add the `preferences` column to the table.

```ruby
rails g migration AddPreferencesToSpreeUsers preferences:text
```

Run the migration.

```ruby
rails db:migrate
```

Define the preference in your model.

```ruby
class Spree::User < ApplicationRecord
  # ... you existing code ...

  # include the preferable module
  include Spree::Preferences::Preferable
  # define the preferences
  preference :language, :string, default: "English"
  preference :sms_marketing, :boolean, default: false
end
```

This will add a `language` preference to the `User` model. The preference will be stored in the newly created `preferences` column of the `spree_users` table. You can add more preferences to the model in the same way.

### Accessing Model Preferences

Once preferences have been defined for a model, they can be accessed either using the shortcut methods that are generated for each preference or the generic methods that are not specific to a particular preference.

#### Shortcut Methods

There are several shortcut methods that are generated. They are shown below.

Query methods:

```ruby
user.prefers_sms_marketing? # => false
```

Reader methods:

```ruby
user.preferred_sms_marketing      # => false
user.preferred_language   # => "English"
```

Writer methods:

```ruby
user.prefers_sms_marketing = false         # => false
user.preferred_language = "English"    # => "English"
```

<Note>
  Remember to run `user.save` after setting the preference value to save the changes to the database.
</Note>

Check if a preference is available:

```ruby
user.has_preference? :sms_marketing
```

#### Generic Methods

Each shortcut method is essentially a wrapper for the various generic methods shown below:

Query method:

```ruby
user.prefers?(:sms_marketing)       # => false
user.prefers?(:language)  # => false
```

Reader methods:

```ruby
user.preferred(:sms_marketing)      # => false
user.preferred(:language)   # => "English"
```

```ruby
user.get_preference :sms_marketing
user.get_preference :language
```

Writer method:

```ruby
user.set_preference(:sms_marketing, false)     # => false
user.set_preference(:language, "English")  # => "English"
```

#### Accessing All Preferences

You can get a hash of all stored preferences by accessing the `preferences` helper:

```ruby
user.preferences # => {"language"=>"English", "sms_marketing"=>false}
```

This hash will contain the value for every preference that has been defined for the model instance, whether the value is the default or one that has been previously stored.
