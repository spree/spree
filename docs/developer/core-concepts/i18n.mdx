## Overview

With Spree you can use different currencies, languages, payment methods per region. You can translate the UI and have different translations for product descriptions, taxons, etc to improve conversions and customer satisfaction.

## Store Default Locale

Each [Store](stores) has their own `default_locale` attribute. Alongside that, you can also set `supported_locales` which will enable multi-language capabilities for that Store.

You can change both in the Admin Panel in `Configurations -> Store` or via rails console / API.

<Info>
For locales, we use symbols such as `en`,`es-MX` etc - full list of supported locales is available in the [Spree I18n GitHub repository](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n/tree/master/config/locales)..
</Info>

## Store Default Currency

As with locale each [Store](stores) has their own `default_currency` attribute. Alongside that, you can also set  `supported_currencies` which will enable multi-currency capabilities for that Store.

You can change both in the Admin Panel in `Configurations -> Store` or via rails console / API.

<Info>
For currencies, we use [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) symbols, eg. `USD` , `CAD`, `EUR`

## Resource Translations

As of Spree 4.6, resources with user-facing content fields now have built in support for translations. Translation functionality is handled by the [Mobility gem](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility). Spree allows you to translate the following resources:

| Resource         | Translatable Fields                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product          | `name`, `description`, `slug`, `meta_description`, `meta_keywords`, `meta_title`                                                                                                             |
| Taxon            | `name`, `description`, `permalink`                                                                                                                                                        |
| Taxonomy         | `name`                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Option Type      | `presentation`                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Option Value     | `presentation`                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Property         | `presentation`                                                                                                                                                   |
| Product Property | `value`                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Store            | `name`, `meta_description`, `meta_keywords`, `seo_title`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `instagram`, `customer_support_email`, `description`, `address`, `contact_phone` |

Our translatable resources are configured with Mobility’s [Table Backend](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility#table-backend-like-globalize) storage strategy. The way this works is that each translatable resource has a corresponding translations table in the database, in which translation values are stored - for example, product translations are stored in `spree_product_translations`.

<Info>
You can read more about how to work with translations by reading [Mobility's usage docs](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility#usage).
</Info>

### Resource Translations Implementation

Each translatable resource includes the `TranslatableResource` module, which sets the default scope for the resource to `i18n`. This makes it so that when querying the translatable resource on a translatable field, Mobility will know to search in the translation tables. Read more about querying translatable fields and the i18n scope in the [Mobility docs](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility#querying).

Due to some shortcomings of the Mobility gem, not all Active Record Query Interface methods work with translations. This includes:

* selecting `distinct` when ordering by a translated field raises an error. To work around this, explicitly select the translated field that you are ordering by. For example, instead of `Spree::Product.order(:name).distinct` do `Spree::Product.select(:name).order(:name).distinct`
* calling `first_or_create` or `first_or_initialize` on a clause that checks for a translated field does not work correctly with Mobility. For example, the following line of code will not perform as expected: `Spree::Product.where(name: ‘Denim Shirt').first_or_create!` Instead, you’ll need to rewrite it as an if statement that calls either `first` or `create` like so:

```ruby
if Spree::Product.where(name: 'Denim Shirt').any?
  Spree::Product.where(name: 'Denim Shirt').first
else
  Spree::Product.create!(name: 'Denim Shirt')
end
```

* Joining on a resource with translations and then filtering by a translated field on the resource that you joined does not work correctly. For example, the following statement will not select the correct products: `Spree::Product.joins(:taxons).where(taxons: {name: "30% Off"})`. Instead, you can make use of the `join_translation_table` method in in the `TranslatableResourceScopes` Module. The above query can be rewritten like this:

```ruby
Spree::Product.joins(:taxons)
              .joins_translation_table(Spree::Taxon)
              .where(Spree::Taxon.translation_table_alias => {name: "30% Off"})
```

<Info>
  If you are using Spree version 4.5 or order and are currently unable to upgrade, you can install [Spree Globalize extension](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_globalize) to enable translations. This extension uses [Globalize](https://github.com/globalize/globalize) library under the hood. We do not recommend this approach and we will not be providing support for it. We recommend upgrading to the Spree 4.6 or newer.
</Info>

## The `spree_i18n` project

Spree now stores all of the translation information in a separate GitHub project known as [Spree I18n](https://github.com/spree/spree_i18n). This is a stand alone project with a large number of volunteer committers who maintain the locale files. This is basically the same approach followed by the Rails project which keeps their localizations in [rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n).

The project is actually a Spree extension. This extension contains translations files. To translate models (provide translations for Products, Taxons, etc) you will need to install also [Spree Globalize](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_globalize).

To install the Spree I18n extension, run the following command:

```bash
bundle add spree_i18n
```

### Translation Files

Each language is stored in a YAML file located in `config/locales`. Each YAML file contains one top level key which is the language code for the translations contained within that file. The following is a snippet showing the basic layout of a locale file:

```yaml
pt-BR:
  spree:
    say_no: "Não"
    say_yes: "Sim"
```

All translations for Spree are "namespaced" within the `spree` key so that they don't conflict with translations from other parts of the parent application.

Please submit Pull Requests or issues directly to [Spree I18n](https://github.com/spree/spree_i18n) for missing translations.

### Localization Files

Spree maintains its localization information in a YAML file using a naming convention similar to that of the Rails project. Each of the localization filenames contains a prefix representing the language code of the locale. For example, the Russian translation is contained in `config/locales/ru.yml`.

Spree has over 43 locale files and counting. See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n/tree/main/config/locales) for a complete list.

### Required Files

Each locale that you wish to support will require both a Rails and Spree translation. The required Spree translation files are available automatically when you install the `spree_i18n` gem.

You don't need to copy any files from `spree_i18n` or `rails-i18n` for their translations to be available within your application. They are made available automatically, because both `spree_i18n` and `rails-i18n` are railties.

## Translating Views

When reviewing the source of any view in Spree you'll notice that all text is rendered by passing a string to a helper method similar to:

```erb
<%= Spree.t(:price) %>
```

The `Spree.t()` helper method looks up the currently configured locale and retrieves the translated value from the relevant locale YAML file. Assuming a default locale, this translation would be fetched from the en translations collated from the application, `spree_i18n` and `rails-i18n`. Its relative key within those translation files would need to be this:

```yaml
en:
  spree:
    price: Price
```

## Localizing Extensions

[Spree extensions](/developer/customization/extensions) can contain their own `config/locales` directory where developers can include YAML files for each language they wish to support.

We strongly urge all extension developers to ensure all customer facing text is rendered via the `Spree.t()` helper method even if they only include a single default language locale file (as other users can simply include the required YAML file and translations in their site extension).
