## Overview

The `Spree::Store` model is the center of the Spree ecosystem. Each Spree installation can have multiple Stores. Each Store operates on a different domain or subdomain, eg.

* Store A, `us.example.com`
* Store B, `eu.example.com`
* Store C, `another-brand.com`

## Current Store

Spree will try to determine the current store based on the current URL. If the URL does not match any of the stores in the database, Spree will fall back to the default store.

All Spree controllers or any other controllers that include [Spree::Core::ControllerHelpers::Store](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/lib/spree/core/controller_helpers/store.rb) have access to the `current_store` method which returns the `Store` matching the current URL.

All parts of Spree (API v1, API v2, Storefront, Admin Panel) have this implemented. This method is also available in views and JSON serializers.

<Info>
Under the hood `current_store` calls [Spree::Stores::FindCurrent.new(url: url).execute](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/finders/spree/stores/find_current.rb).

This logic can be easily overwritten by setting 

```ruby
Spree::Dependencies.current_store_finder = 'MyStoreFinderClass'
```

in `config/initializers/spree.rb` file
</Info>

## Default Store

If the system cannot find any Store that matches the current URL it will fall back to the Default Store.

You can set the default Store in `Admin Panel -> Configurations -> Store` or via Rails console:

```ruby
Spree::Store.find(2).update(default: true)
```

To get the default store in your code or rails console type:

```ruby
Spree::Store.default
```

## Localization and Currency

Each Store can have multiple locales and currencies. This configuration is stored in Store model attributes:

| Attribute             | Description                                                                                                   | Example(s)                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `default_currency`    | This is the default currency that will be pre-selected when visiting the store the first time.                | `USD`                       |
| `supported_currencies`| If there is more than one supported currency, visitors will be able to choose which currency they browse in.  | `USD`, `CAD`, `EUR`          |
| `default_locale`      | This is the default locale/language which will be pre-selected when visiting the store the first time.        | `en`                        |
| `supported_locales`   | If there is more than one supported locale, visitors can choose which locale they browse in. Locales are available upon installing [Spree I18n](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n). | `en`, `fr`, `de` |

### Translations

As of version 4.6, the `Store` resource allows for translating many of its fields. Translations are enabled when selecting more than one locale in `supported_locales`. The following fields are translatable:

* `name`
* `meta_description`
* `meta_keywords`
* `seo_title`
* `facebook`
* `twitter`
* `instagram`
* `customer_support_email`
* `description`
* `address`
* `contact_phone`
* `new_order_notifications_email`

Read more about how resource translations work in [Internationalization](i18n#resource-translations).

## Checkout configuration

Each Store can be configured to ship to only selected countries. This is achieved via the `checkout_zone_id` attribute which holds the ID of the selected [Zone record](shipments#zones).

Available Shipping Methods on the Checkout are determined based on the [Zone and Shipping Methods configuration](shipments).

This will also have an effect on what [Shipping / Billing Addresses](/developer/core-concepts/addresses) user can add/ select during Checkout. Only Addresses from Countries or States available in the selected Zone can be used and will be visible in the User's Address Book.

## Store resources

Each Store can have its own resources. For example, a Store can have its own Products, Taxonomies, Promotions, etc.

| Resource                                          | Relationship                                                                                                                               |

## Custom Domains

Spree supports managing custom domains for Stores. This is useful for multi-store setups where each store has its own domain.

In the Admin Panel, you can manage custom domains for each Store in the **Settings -> Domains** page.
