**Key relationships:**
- **Store** is the central model - all commerce data is scoped to a store
- Each store has one or more [Markets](/developer/core-concepts/markets) that define geographic selling regions with their own currency and locale
- Each store has its own [Orders](/developer/core-concepts/orders), [Products](/developer/core-concepts/products), [Payment Methods](/developer/core-concepts/payments), and [Shipping Methods](/developer/core-concepts/shipments)
- Stores can have different currencies, locales, and configurations
- Content (Menus, CMS Pages) and [Webhooks](/developer/core-concepts/webhooks) are also store-specific

To access the current store you can use `current_store` in controllers or `Spree::Store.current` in models/services/jobs.

#### Via Store API

```javascript
import { createSpreeClient } from '@spree/sdk'

const client = createSpreeClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-store.com',
  publishableKey: '<api-key>',
})

const store = await client.store.store.get()
```

## Markets

[Markets](/developer/core-concepts/markets) let you segment your store into geographic regions, each with its own currency, locale, and set of countries. For example, a single store can have:

- **North America** — USD, English, ships to US and Canada
- **Europe** — EUR, German, ships to DE, FR, AT, NL
- **United Kingdom** — GBP, English, ships to GB

For full details on creating and managing markets, see the [Markets](/developer/core-concepts/markets) guide.

Each Store can have its own resources. For example, a Store can have its own Products, Taxonomies, Promotions, etc.
