In your Spree application you will usually have 2 types of users:

* Customers - who are the users who will be purchasing products
* Admins - who are the users who will be managing the Spree store

Customers can have:

* **[Addresses](/developer/core-concepts/addresses)**, both billing and shipping
* **[Orders](/developer/core-concepts/orders)** - a list of products that the user has purchased
* **Credit Cards** - used on the checkout page to pay for the order
* **Store Credits** - assigned by the store owners, to be used to purchase products
* **Wishlists** - a list of products that the user has marked as a wishlist

## User model

The default user class is `Spree::User` which is generated during Spree installation.

You should however reference Users with an universal `Spree.user_class` to avoid any potential issues, eg.

```ruby
Spree.user_class.find_by(email: "spree@example.com")
```

<Info>
You can use your own User class. More on this in the [Customize Authentication guide](/developer/customization/authentication).

## User attributes

Here's the list of attributes for the default `Spree::User` model:

| Attribute         | Description                                                                 | Example Value       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `email`           | The email address of the user.                                              | `user@example.com`  |
| `ship_address_id` | References the default shipping address associated with the user.                   | `2`                 |
| `bill_address_id` | References the default billing address associated with the user.                    | `3`                 |

There will be lots more attributes provided by [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem, but these are the most important ones for the user.

## User roles

Each User can have different roles attached, eg. `admin` (which will grant them access to the Spree admin).

To attach a role to a user, you can use this code:

```ruby
user = Spree::User.find_by(email: "spree@example.com")
role = Spree::Role.find_or_create_by(name: 'admin')

user.spree_roles << role
```

## User methods

`Spree::User` includes several [ActiveRecord concerns](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3.2/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html), which provide additional methods for the user model.

Some handy methods are listed below:

```ruby Returns the last incomplete order for the given store.
user.last_incomplete_spree_order(store)
```

```ruby Returns the total amount available store credits for the user in the given store.
user.available_store_credits(store)
```

```ruby Returns the default Wishlist for the given Store.
user.default_wishlist_for_store(store)
```

```ruby Returns a list of all active payment sources, e.g., credit cards that can be used on the checkout.
user.payment_sources
```

## User Permissions

Spree under the hood uses library called [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) to handle authorization.

More on permissions can be found in the [Customize Permissions guide](/developer/customization/permissions). We recommend you check this guide after reading all other Core Concepts.

## Current user

In all Spree controllers or any controller inheriting from `Spree::BaseController`, you can access the current user with `spree_current_user` method.

```ruby
spree_current_user
```
