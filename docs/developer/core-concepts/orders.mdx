## Overview

The `Order` model is one of the key models in Spree. It provides a central place around which to collect information about a customer order - including line items, adjustments, payments, addresses, return authorizations, and shipments.

## Order methods

Here is a list of methods you may find useful:

| Method                      | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `outstanding_balance`       | The outstanding balance for the order, calculated by taking the `total` and subtracting `payment_total`. |
| `display_item_total`        | A "pretty" version of `item_total`. If `item_total` was `10.0`, `display_item_total` would be `$10.00`. |
| `display_adjustment_total`  | Same as above, except for `adjustment_total`.                                                 |
| `display_total`             | Same as above, except for `total`.                                                            |
| `display_outstanding_balance` | Same as above, except for `outstanding_balance`.                                              |

To see all available methods, please check the [Order model source code](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/order.rb).

## The Order State Machine

Each Order flows through a state machine, beginning at a `cart` state and ending up at a `complete` state.

<Note>
This is the default order flow and can be adjusted or overhauled completely.

More on this topic at [Customizing Checkout page](../customization/checkout).
</Note>

The default states are as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="cart">
    Initial state, you can treat it as a draft order
  </Step>
  <Step title="address">
    Buyer started the checkout process and is on the address step
  </Step>
  <Step title="delivery">
    Buyer has added Shipping and Billing addresses, now he or she needs to select a delivery option
  </Step>
  <Step title="payment">
    Buyer selected delivery option, now he or she needs to add a payment option

    <Note>
      Only available if `Order#payment_required?` returns `true`. For most orders it will be `true`, but if the order is paid entirely with [Store Credit](store-credit) it will be `false`.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="confirm">
    Buyer added payment option, now he or she needs to confirm the order

    <Note>
      Only available if `Order#confirmation_required?` returns `true`
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="complete">
    Order was placed. It will set the `completed_at` date to the current time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Assuming that an order meets the criteria for the next state, you will be able to transition it to the next state by calling `next` on that object, eg. 

```ruby
order = Spree::Order.find_by(number: 'R123456')
order.next
```

If this returns `false`, then the order does _not_ meet the criteria. To work out why it cannot transition, check the result of an `errors` method call.

### Order Shipment states

Alongside the global Order state there's also `shipment_state` column which indicates the state of all shipments. Order can have multiple shipments.

| State     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `shipped` | all Shipments are in the `shipped` state |
| `partial` | at least one Shipment has a state of `shipped` and there is another Shipment with a state other than `shipped` or there are [InventoryUnits](inventory) associated with the order that have a state of `sold` but are not associated with a Shipment |
| `ready`   | all Shipments are in the `ready` state |
| `backorder` | there is backordered inventory associated with an order |
| `pending` | all Shipments are in the `pending` state |

For more on this please go to [Shipment States page](shipments).

### Order Payment states

Alongside the global Order state there's also `payment_state` column which indicates the state of all payments. Order can have multiple payments.

| State        | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `paid`       | `payment_total` is equal to `total`                 |
| `balance_due`| `payment_total` is less than `total`                |
| `credit_owed`| `payment_total` is greater than `total`             |
| `failed`     | most recent payment is in the `failed` state        |
| `void`       | order is canceled and `payment_total` is equal to `zero` |

For more on this please go to [Payment States page](payments).

## Line Items

Line items are used to keep track of items within the context of an order. These records provide a link between orders, and [Variants](products#variants).

<Warning>
When a variant is added to an order, the price of that item is tracked along with the line item to preserve that data. If the variant's price were to change, then the line item would still have a record of the price at the time of ordering.
</Warning>

## Addresses

An order can link to two `Address` objects. The shipping address indicates where the order's products should be shipped to. This address is used to determine which shipping methods are available for an order.

The billing address indicates where the user who's paying for the order is located. This can alter the tax rate for the order, which in turn can change how much the final order total can be.

For more information about addresses, please read the [Addresses](/developer/core-concepts/addresses) guide.

## Adjustments

Adjustments are used to affect an order's final cost, either by decreasing it [Promotions](promotions) or by increasing it [Shipping](shipments), [Taxes](taxation).

For more information about adjustments, please see the [Adjustments](adjustments) guide.

## Payments

Payment records are used to track payment information about an order. Each Order can hold multiple payments, eg. one for each credit card or debit card and one for the store credit. 

For more information, please read the [Payments](payments) guide.

## Return Authorizations

An order can have many `ReturnAuthorization` objects. These records keeps track of which items have been authorized for return and how the user will be compensated -- either via exchanging the items or a reimbursement.

## Updating an Order

If you change any aspect of an `Order` object within code and you wish to update the order's totals -- including associated adjustments and shipments -- call the `update_with_updater!` method on that object, which calls out to the [OrderUpdater](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/models/spree/order_updater.rb) class.

For example, if you create or modify an existing payment for the order which would change the order's `payment_state` to a different value, calling `update_with_updater!` will cause the `payment_state` to be recalculated for that order.

Another example is if a `LineItem` within the order had its price changed. Calling `update_with_updater!` will cause the totals for the order to be updated, the adjustments for the order to be recalculated, and then a final total to be established.
