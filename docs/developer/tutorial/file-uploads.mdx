## Step 1: Add Attachments to the Model

Now we need to add attachments to the brand model. Spree uses [Rails Active Storage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) engine to handle the attachments, image processing and storage. It can also be used for non-image files.

Let's add a logo attachment to the brand model:

```ruby app/models/spree/brand.rb
module Spree
  class Brand < Spree::Base
    has_one_attached :logo # [!code ++]

    # ... other code ...
  end
end
```

## Step 2: Add Attachments uploader in the Admin Dashboard
