description: Learn how to create Admin Dashboard UI to manage Brands
---

Now that we've created a complete "Brand" model, let's create an Admin Dashboard interface so our admins can manage the brands.

## Step 1: Create the boilerplate Admin Dashboard UI

Admin Scaffold generator is a tool that helps us create a complete Admin Dashboard UI for our new resource.

Run the following command in our Spree application root directory:

```bash
bin/rails g spree:admin:scaffold Spree::Brand
```

This will create the following files:

| File Type | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|------|
| Controller | `app/controllers/spree/admin/brands_controller.rb` | Handles the logic for the brands resource. |
| View | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/index.html.erb` | Handles displaying the list of brands in the Admin Dashboard. |
| View | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/new.html.erb` | Handles displaying the new brand form in the Admin Dashboard. |
| View | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/edit.html.erb` | Handles displaying the edit brand form in the Admin Dashboard. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_header.html.erb` | Handles displaying the table header in the brands index view. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_row.html.erb` | Handles displaying the table row in the brands index view. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_filters.html.erb` | Handles displaying the filters in the brands index view. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_form.html.erb` | Handles displaying the form in the new and edit brand views. |

It will also automatically add the following routes to your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
namespace :admin do
  resources :brands
end
```

You will now be able to access the brands resource at `http://localhost:3000/admin/brands` in your browser. To reference this route in your code, you can use the `spree.admin_brands_path` helper.

## Step 2: Add Navigation Menu Item

Now that we've created a complete Admin Dashboard UI for the brand resource, let's add a navigation menu item to the main sidebar so we can access it from the admin dashboard.

### Create Navigation Partial

Run the following command to create the navigation partial:

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/spree/admin/shared && touch app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_nav.html.erb
```

And add the following content:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_nav.html.erb
<% if can?(:manage, Spree::Brand) %>
  <%= nav_item(
    Spree.t(:brands),
    spree.admin_brands_path,
    icon: 'tag',
    active: controller_name == 'brands'
  ) %>
<% end %>
```

**Key elements:**
- Wrap with `can?()` authorization check
- Use `nav_item` helper for proper formatting
- Specify icon from [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons)
- Define active state based on controller name
- Use `spree.` prefix for route helpers

### Register Navigation Partial

Add to `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

```ruby config/initializers/spree.rb
Rails.application.config.spree_admin.store_nav_partials << 'spree/admin/shared/brands_nav'
```

This adds the navigation item to the main sidebar after Reports and before Storefront.

### Alternative: Add as Submenu Item

To add Brands under the existing Products menu, use the products injection point:

Run the following command to create the products navigation partial:

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/spree/admin/shared && touch app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_products_nav.html.erb
```

And add the following content:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_products_nav.html.erb
<% if can?(:manage, Spree::Brand) %>
  <%= nav_item(
    Spree.t(:brands),
    spree.admin_brands_path,
    active: controller_name == 'brands'
  ) %>
<% end %>
```

**Register:**

```ruby config/initializers/spree.rb
Rails.application.config.spree_admin.store_products_nav_partials << 'spree/admin/shared/brands_products_nav'
```
