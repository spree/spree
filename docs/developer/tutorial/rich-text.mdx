description: Learn how to add rich text content to the Brands feature using Action Text

<Info>
  This guide assumes you've completed the [Model](/developer/tutorial/model) and [Admin](/developer/tutorial/admin) tutorials.
</Info>

Our Brand model has a `name` attribute to store the brand name. However it's missing a description. That's because we're going to use [Action Text](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html) to handle the rich text content.

## Step 1: Add Action Text to the Model

```ruby app/models/spree/brand.rb {4-5}
module Spree
  class Brand < Spree::Base
    # Action text for rich text content
    has_rich_text :description

    # ... other code ...
  end
end
```

You don't need to run any migrations, as we won't be adding any new columns to the `spree_brands` table. That's because [Action Text](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html) stores all the rich text content in a separate table called `action_text_rich_texts`.

You can access the description content in code like this:

```ruby
brand.description.to_s
# => "<h1>Hello</h1><p>World</p>"
```

Or if you prefer plain text:

```ruby
brand.description.to_plain_text
# => "Hello World"
```

## Step 2: Add a WYSIWYG editor to the Admin Dashboard

In the Admin dashboard we want to use a WYSIWYG editor to add formatted text to the brand description. To do this, edit the `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_form.html.erb` file and add the following code:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/brands/_form.html.erb {4}
<div class="card mb-4">
  <div class="card-body">
    <%= f.spree_text_field :name %>
    <%= f.spree_rich_text_area :description %>
  </div>
</div>
```

This will render a WYSIWYG editor to the brand description field in the Admin dashboard.

## Step 3: Update permitted parameters in controller

To permit the `description` attribute to be saved, we need to update the permitted parameters in the controller.   file and add the following code:

```ruby app/controllers/spree/admin/brands_controller.rb {9}
module Spree
  module Admin
    class BrandsController < ResourceController
      private

      def permitted_resource_params
        params.require(:brand).permit(
          :name,
          :description
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```
