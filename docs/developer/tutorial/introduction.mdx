This tutorial walks you through creating a complete Spree feature from scratch, covering models, Admin dashboard, API and Storefront. 
You will also learn how to extend core Spree features to connect them with your new feature.
By the end, you'll understand how to add new manageable features to the Spree platform.

## Overview

Spree is built on top of [Ruby on Rails framework](https://rubyonrails.org) and follows Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. To fully implement a new feature, you will typically create the following components:
* Database model
* Admin Dashboard controllers and views
* API endpoints
* Storefront views
* Automated tests

## Example: Building a Brands Feature

In this guide we will create a complete "Brands" feature that allows admins to manage [Product](/developer/core-concepts/products) brands.
