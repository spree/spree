This tutorial walks you through creating a complete Spree feature from scratch, covering models, Admin dashboard, API and Storefront. 
You will also learn how to extend core Spree features to connect them with your new feature.
By the end, you'll understand how to add new manageable features to the Spree platform.

## Overview

Building a Spree feature typically involves:

1. [Creating a database model](/developer/tutorial/custom-feature/model) to store data and business logic
2. [Creating Admin Dashboard UI](/developer/tutorial/custom-feature/admin) to manage the feature from the Admin panel, usually standard CRUD operations (create-read-update-delete)
3. [Adding API endpoints](/developer/tutorial/custom-feature/api) to allow for accessing the feature from a mobile app or headless storefront
4. [Adding Storefront](/developer/tutorial/custom-feature/storefront) to allow customers to interact with the feature from the storefront
5. [Writing tests](/developer/tutorial/custom-feature/testing) to ensure the feature works as expected

## Example: Building a Brands Feature

In this guide we will create a complete "Brands" feature that allows admins to manage [Product](/developer/core-concepts/products) brands.

By now you should have Spree [installed locally](/developer/getting-started/quickstart) on your system. This guide will assume you have basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails web framework.
