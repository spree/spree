Now that we've created a complete "Brand" model, let's create a Admin Dashboard interface so we can manage the brands.

## Step 1: Create the boilerplate Admin Dashboard UI

Admin Scaffold generator is a tool that helps you create a complete Admin Dashboard UI for your new resource.

Run the following command in your Spree application root directory:

```bash
bin/rails g spree:admin:scaffold Spree::Brand
```

This will create the following files:

| File Type | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|------|
| Controller | `app/controllers/spree/admin/brands_controller.rb` | Handles the logic for the brands resource. |
| View | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/index.html.erb` | Handles displaying the list of brands in the Admin Dashboard. |
| View | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/new.html.erb` | Handles displaying the new brand form in the Admin Dashboard. |
| View | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/edit.html.erb` | Handles displaying the edit brand form in the Admin Dashboard. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_header.html.erb` | Handles displaying the table header in the brands index view. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_row.html.erb` | Handles displaying the table row in the brands index view. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_filters.html.erb` | Handles displaying the filters in the brands index view. |
| Partial | `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_form.html.erb` | Handles displaying the form in the new and edit brand views. |

It will also automatically add the following routes to your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
namespace :admin do
  resources :brands
end
```

You will now be able to access the brands resource at `http://localhost:3000/admin/brands` in your browser. To reference this route in your code, you can use the `spree.admin_brands_path` helper.

## Step 2: Add ability for admins to create new Brands

Firstly, we will need to customize the controller and specify permitted parameters which users can submit through the new/edit form:

```ruby app/controllers/spree/admin/brands_controller.rb
module Spree
  module Admin
    class BrandsController < ResourceController
      private

      # [!code ++:8]
      # Define permitted parameters which users can submit through the new/edit form
      def permitted_resource_params
        params.require(:brand).permit(
          :name,
          :slug,
          :status,
          :description,
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Now that we have that, we need to add the fields to the `form.html.erb` partial:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/brands/_form.html.erb
<div class="card mb-4">
  <div class="card-body">
    <%= f.spree_text_field :name, required: true, autofocus: true %>
    <!-- [!code ++:6] -->
    <%= f.spree_text_field :slug,
        required: true,
        help: "URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated from name)" %>

    <%= f.spree_rich_text_area :description,
        help: "Optional brand description" %>
  </div>
</div>
```

This partial is used for both the new and edit brand forms. `f` is the form builder instance, you can use it to render the form fields.

We're using `spree_text_field` and `spree_rich_text_area` methods to create the form fields. These are [Spree::Admin::FormBuilder](/developer/admin/form-builder) methods that are automatically available in the form builder. It will render a field, label and handle validation errors automatically. You can also pass `help` to display hints or other information to the user.

Using the Spree Admin Form Builder ensures that the form fields are styled consistently with the rest of the Admin Dashboard.

### Step 3: Customize the list view

To display more information about the brand, we need to customize the list view.

Customize `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_header.html.erb` file to add the following content:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_header.html.erb
<tr>
  <th scope="col"><%= sort_link @search, :name, Spree.t(:name) %></th>
  <th scope="col"><%= Spree.t(:status) %></th>
  <th scope="col"><%= sort_link @search, :created_at, Spree.t(:created_at) %></th>
  <th scope="col"></th>
</tr>
```

The `sort_link` helper provides sortable column headers that work with Ransack.

### Table Row Partial

Customize `app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_row.html.erb` file to add the following content:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/brands/_table_row.html.erb
<tr id="<%= spree_dom_id(brand) %>" data-controller="row-link" class="cursor-pointer">
  <td data-action="click->row-link#openLink"><%= brand.name %></td>
  <td data-action="click->row-link#openLink">
    <%= active_badge(brand.active?) %>
  </td>
  <td data-action="click->row-link#openLink">
    <%= brand.created_at.strftime('%B %d, %Y') %>
  </td>
  <td class="actions">
    <%= link_to_edit brand, data: { row_link_target: 'link', turbo_frame: '_top' } if can?(:edit, brand) %>
  </td>
</tr>
```

**Key features:**
- `data-controller="row-link"` - Makes entire row clickable
- `spree_dom_id(brand)` - Generates unique ID for Turbo updates
- `active_badge` helper - Displays consistent status badges
- `link_to_edit` helper - Standard edit link with proper permissions
- Dropdown menu for additional actions
- `turbo_frame: '_top'` - Ensures edit navigates full page


### Form Partial

This one is a bit more complex. We need to customize it to add the following fields:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/brands/_form.html.erb
<div class="card mb-4" data-controller="slug-form">
  <div class="card-header">
    <h5 class="card-title">
      <%= Spree.t(:general_settings) %>
    </h5>
  </div>

  <div class="card-body">
    <%= f.spree_text_field :name,
        required: true,
        help: "Brand name as displayed to customers",
        data: { slug_form_target: :name, action: 'slug-form#updateUrlFromName' } %>

    <%= f.spree_text_field :slug,
        required: true,
        help: "URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated from name)",
        data: { slug_form_target: :url } %>

    <%= f.spree_rich_text_area :description,
        help: "Optional brand description" %>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card mb-4">
  <div class="card-header">
    <h5 class="card-title"><%= Spree.t(:images) %></h5>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <%= f.label :logo, Spree.t(:logo) %>
    <%= render 'active_storage/upload_form',
        form: f,
        field_name: :logo,
        width: 800,
        height: 400 %>
    <%= f.error_message_on :logo %>
  </div>
</div>
```

Let's break down each part:
- `data-controller="slug-form"` - Use [Stimulus controllers](/developer/core-concepts/stimulus) for slug generation preview (so user don't need to type the slug manually)
- `spree_text_field :name` - Use [Spree::Admin::FormBuilder](/developer/admin/form-builder) method to create a text field for the name
- `spree_text_field :slug` - Use [Spree::Admin::FormBuilder](/developer/admin/form-builder) method to create a text field for the slug
- `spree_rich_text_area :description` - Use [Spree::Admin::FormBuilder](/developer/admin/form-builder) method to create a rich text area for the description
- `active_storage/upload_form` - Use [Rails Active Storage](/developer/core-concepts/active-storage) partial to upload the logo
- `f.error_message_on :logo` - Use [Rails Active Record](/developer/core-concepts/active-record) method to display error messages for the logo field

## Step 4: Add Navigation Menu Item

Now that we've created a complete Admin Dashboard UI for the brand resource, let's add a navigation menu item to the main sidebar so we can access it from the admin dashboard.

### Create Navigation Partial

Run the following command to create the navigation partial:

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/spree/admin/shared && touch app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_nav.html.erb
```

And add the following content:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_nav.html.erb
<% if can?(:manage, Spree::Brand) %>
  <%= nav_item(
    Spree.t(:brands),
    spree.admin_brands_path,
    icon: 'tag',
    active: controller_name == 'brands'
  ) %>
<% end %>
```

**Key elements:**
- Wrap with `can?()` authorization check
- Use `nav_item` helper for proper formatting
- Specify icon from [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons)
- Define active state based on controller name
- Use `spree.` prefix for route helpers

### Register Navigation Partial

Add to `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

```ruby config/initializers/spree.rb
Rails.application.config.spree_admin.store_nav_partials << 'spree/admin/shared/brands_nav'
```

This adds the navigation item to the main sidebar after Reports and before Storefront.

### Alternative: Add as Submenu Item

To add Brands under the existing Products menu, use the products injection point:

Run the following command to create the products navigation partial:

```bash
mkdir -p app/views/spree/admin/shared && touch app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_products_nav.html.erb
```

And add the following content:

```erb app/views/spree/admin/shared/_brands_products_nav.html.erb
<% if can?(:manage, Spree::Brand) %>
  <%= nav_item(
    Spree.t(:brands),
    spree.admin_brands_path,
    active: controller_name == 'brands'
  ) %>
<% end %>
```

**Register:**

```ruby config/initializers/spree.rb
Rails.application.config.spree_admin.store_products_nav_partials << 'spree/admin/shared/brands_products_nav'
```
