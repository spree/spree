description: Learn how to write automated tests for the Brands feature

Automated testing is a crucial part of the development process. It helps you ensure that your code works as expected and catches bugs early. 
Spree uses [RSpec](https://rspec.info) and [Factory Bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails) for testing. 
We also provide `spree_dev_tools` gem that helps you writing Spree-specific tests.

## Setup
 
### Step 1: Set RSpec as the test framework

```bash
bin/rails g rspec:install
```

You can also remove the `test/` directory if you don't need it.

```bash
rm -rf test/
```

### Step 2: Run `spree_dev_tools` generator

```bash
bin/rails g spree_dev_tools:install
```

This will add Spree-specific test helpers to Rspec.

### Step 3: Create a test for the Brands feature

```bash
bin/rails g factory_bot:model Spree::Brand
```

```bash
bin/rails g rspec:model Spree::Brand
```
