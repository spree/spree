## Step 1: Create Database Migration

First we need to create a database migration to add the new brand model to the database. Database migrations are used to create or modify the database schema. They are typically created using the `rails g migration` command. Each migration file is named after the change it makes, date and time of creation, and contains the SQL commands to perform the change.

Create a new model migration file by running the following command in your Spree application root directory:

```bash
bin/rails g model spree/brand name:string:index --parent Spree::Base
```

This will create a new migration file at `db/migrate/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_create_spree_brands.rb` and a model file at `app/models/spree/brand.rb`.

Now run the migration:

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

This command will create the `spree_brands` table in the database and add the necessary indexes. It will also update your `db/schema.rb` file to reflect the changes.

## Step 2: Extend the Model file

Now that the model file is created, let's add some additional functionality to it, starting with validations:

```ruby app/models/spree/brand.rb
module Spree
  class Brand < Spree::Base
    # [!code ++:2]
    # Validations
    validates :name, presence: true
  end
end
```

This is a standard [Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord model](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html). Let's break down each part:
- Inherits from `Spree::Base` to automatically inherit all Spree functionality. Also the model itself is namespaced under `Spree::` module, so it's available as `Spree::Brand` in the application.
- `validates :name, presence: true` - using ActiveRecord validations to ensure that the name is present.
