## Tenant class

The center of the multi-tenant architecture is the `Spree::Tenant` class. This is the highest level class in the multi-tenant system.

Every tenanted model includes a `tenant_id` column. This is used to identify which tenant a record belongs to. It's row-level multi-tenancy.

After creating a new tenant it will automatically create store and run [Spree seeds](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/core/app/services/spree/seeds) to populate data such as countries, zones, tax rates, etc.

## Tenanted models

All models that are tenanted inherit from `SpreeMultiTenant::Base` class. `spree_multi_tenant` automatically sets the `Spree.base_class` to `SpreeMultiTenant::Base` so all standard Spree models will be tenanted (with an exclusion of `Spree::CustomDomain`).

When creating a new model that you want to be tenanted remember to inherit from `SpreeMultiTenant::Base` and not from `Spree::Base` and add `tenant_id` column to the table, eg.

```bash
bin/rails g model Spree::NewModel tenant:references name:string
```

```ruby
class Spree::NewModel < SpreeMultiTenant::Base
end
```

<Info>
  You don't need to add `belongs_to :tenant` to the model, it's handled by gem.
</Info>

## Tenant selector

By default the current tenant is selected based on the subdomain or `Spree::CustomDomain`. The selector works in tandem with the default [Spree::Stores::FindCurrent](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/main/core/app/finders/spree/stores/find_current.rb) finder.

First it finds the current store, and later sets the current tenant based on the store's `tenant_id`.

Tenant record is accessible in views and controllers as `current_tenant`. In models you can access it via `SpreeMultiTenant.current_tenant`.

<Info>
  One tenant can have multiple stores. Calling `Spree::Store.default` will return the default store for the first tenant.
</Info>

## Code isolation

All code run when `SpreeMultiTenant.current_tenant` is set will be executed in the context of the tenant, what that means:

* all finder queries will always attach `tenant_id = <current_tenant.id>` to the query
* all writes will automatically set `tenant_id` to the current tenant ID (you don't need to do it manually)

<Warning>
  [insert_all](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html#method-i-insert_all) / [upsert_all](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html#method-i-upsert_all) methods will require you to manually set `tenant_id` to the desired value.
</Warning>

## Background jobs

Background jobs enqueued when `SpreeMultiTenant.current_tenant` is set will be executed in the context of the tenant.

## Enforce tenant context

Sometimes when you're not sure if the tenant context is active you can use `SpreeMultiTenant.with_tenant` to enforce it, eg.

```ruby
SpreeMultiTenant.with_tenant(tenant) do
  # all operations here will be executed in the context of the tenant
end
```

## Excluding tenant context

Sometimes you want to run a piece of code outside of the tenant context, for that you can use `SpreeMultiTenant.without_tenant`

```ruby
SpreeMultiTenant.without_tenant do
  # all operations here will be executed outside of the tenant context
end
```

## Command line

When using `bin/rails console` or `bin/rails runner` you can set the tenant context by:

```ruby
SpreeMultiTenant.current_tenant = Spree::Store.find_by(code: 'my_store').tenant
```
