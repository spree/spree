title: Building a Multi-Tenant Spree Application
sidebarTitle: Quickstart

Spree out of the box is a single-tenant application. You can have multiple stores on the same instance of Spree, but they share the same products, admin user accounts and other resources.
Multi-Store Spree setup is recommended for running multiple brands or multiple language versions of the same brand on the same instance.

If you want to have a true multi-tenant application, you will need to purchase [Enterprise Edition license](https://spreecommerce.org/pricing) which includes `spree_multi_tenant` gem providing full multi-tenant support.

## Multi-Store vs Multi-Tenant

To sum it up:

* Multi-Store setup is recommended for running multiple brands or multiple language versions of the same store
* Multi-Tenant allows you to create a SaaS application with multiple tenants, each of them with their own Spree instance
