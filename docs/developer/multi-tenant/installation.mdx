<Warning>
  This installation instructions assume you have a clean Spree Starter installation and you've purchased the [Spree Enterprise Edition license](https://spreecommerce.org/pricing).
  
  For migrating existing application from single-tenant to multi-tenant, please contact us at [support@spreecommerce.org](mailto:support@spreecommerce.org).
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

* You need to be on Spree 5.1+, we recommend using [spree_starter](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter) as a base for your application
* You need to have 2 environment variables set:
  * `KEYGEN_ACCOUNT_ID`
  * `KEYGEN_LICENSE_KEY`
* We support both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases

<Info>
  Environment variables will be provided to you after purchasing the [Spree Enterprise Edition license](https://spreecommerce.org/pricing).
</Info>

<Warning>
  You will need to add these environment variables to your CI/CD pipeline and production environments.
</Warning>

## Customer User Class

Please follow [Authentication](/docs/developer/customization/authentication) documentation to create a new user class.

Now we will need to make slight adjustments to the generated user class so it can work in a multi-tenant environment.

If you're using Devise, you will need to remove `:validatable` module. This module is responsible for validating the user's email uniqueness. We need to change it to validate it in the scope of the tenant.

Spree Multi-Tenant gem injects `SpreeMultiTenant::CustomerUserConcern` that handles that instead.

## Admin User Class

For our multi-tenant setup we will need a separate Admin user class. Our standard User class will be only used for customer accounts which will be isolated by tenant. 
Admin user classes will be shared across tenants allowing them to manage multiple tenants from a single admin panel.

Let's create a new model with Devise (unless you already have one):

```bash
rails g devise Spree::AdminUser
```

Replace the generated Devise code with the following:

```ruby
class Spree::AdminUser < Spree::Base
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
        :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable

  # Spree modules
  include Spree::UserMethods
end
```

If you already have a custom Admin user class, you can add the following code to it:

```ruby
  # Spree modules
  include Spree::UserMethods
```

This will make sure that the Admin user class works well with Spree ecosystem.

Register new model in `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

```ruby
Spree.admin_user_class = "Spree::AdminUser"
```

## Installing gems

1. Add the following code to your `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    source "https://license:#{ENV['KEYGEN_LICENSE_KEY']}@rubygems.pkg.keygen.sh/#{ENV['KEYGEN_ACCOUNT_ID']}" do
      gem 'spree_enterprise'
      gem 'spree_multi_tenant'
    end
    ```

2. Install gems:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3. Run generators:

    ```bash
    bundle exec rails g spree_enterprise:install && bundle exec rails g spree_multi_tenant:install
    ```

    <Info>
      This will copy and run migrations for `spree_enterprise` and `spree_multi_tenant` gems.
