Follow the instructions below to learn how to build and deploy your Spree Commerce store.

## 1. Installing Spree

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Spree Installer">
    Use the guided installer to set up your Spree Commerce application with all the required dependencies (Ruby, Rails, etc.) on your system.

    Copy and paste the following command to your terminal:

    ```bash
    bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/install.sh)"
    ```

    This will fire up the guided installer that will ask you a few questions (eg. application name, load sample data, etc.) and then set up your Spree Commerce application.

    <Info>
      On Windows please install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) first.
      ```bash
      wsl --install
      ```
      Then run the installer from within WSL.
    </Info>

    <Warning>
      Minimum system requirements for MacOS:
      * MacOS 14.0+
      * XCode command line tools installed
    </Warning>

    <Info>
      If you have any issues with the installer, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/new). Thank you!

        ```

        bin/rails spree_sample:load
