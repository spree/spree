## Getting Started with Spree Commerce

Welcome to the Spree Commerce [open-source eCommerce](https://spreecommerce.org) documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to build and deploy your Spree Commerce store.

### 1. Installing Spree

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Getting the Spree Starter template">
    <Info>
      [Spree Starter](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter/) is a pre-configured Rails application that comes with Spree Commerce, the official [Stripe gem](https://github.com/spree/spree_stripe/), and some other useful gems installed. It is highly recommended to use Spree Starter to get started with Spree Commerce.
    </Info>

    <Note>
      If you're on Windows remember to [install the Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) before proceeding.
    </Note>

    1. Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) if you don't have it already.

    2. Clone the Spree starter template:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/spree/spree_starter.git
        ```

    3. Go to the repository directory:

        ```bash
        cd spree_starter
        ```      

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up Your Development Environment">
    Now that you have the Spree Starter template, you can start setting up your development environment.
  
    1. Install required dependencies

        On MacOS you can install the dependencies using [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/):

        ```bash
        brew install vips libpq
        ```

        On debian-based systems you can install the dependencies using the package manager:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install libvips-dev libpq-dev
        ```

    2. Install Ruby

        Spree is based on [Ruby and Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), hence you need to install Ruby language.

        Install [rbenv (ruby version manager)](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):

        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://rbenv.org/install.sh | bash
        ```

        And now install Ruby 3.3:

        Before attempting to install Ruby, check that your build environment has the necessary tools and libraries.(https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki#suggested-build-environment)

        ```bash
        rbenv install 3.3.0 && rbenv global 3.3.0
        ```

    3. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

    4. Start Docker Compose services:

        <Info>
          Docker needs to be running before running the setup commands.
        </Info>

        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```

        This will start the PostgreSQL database which is required for Spree to work. You can also use other databases like MySQL.

    5. Run setup commands:

       ```bash
       bin/setup
       ```

        This will install the necessary gems, run the database migrations and seed the database with some sample data.

    6. And finally start the development server with:

       ```bash
       bin/dev
       ```

        This will start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="box" title="Adding sample data">
    To add sample data to your store, run:

    ```bash
    bin/rake spree_sample:load
    ```

    This will add a some products, categories, and will setup a checkout flow to your store.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Exploring Your Store
