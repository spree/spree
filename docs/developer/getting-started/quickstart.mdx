## Installation options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="create-spree-app">
    The quickest way to get started. Scaffolds a full Spree project with Next.js Storefront (optional).

    **Requirements:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) running.

    ```bash
    npx create-spree-app@latest my-store
    ```

    The CLI walks you through an interactive setup:

    1. Choose **Full-stack** (Backend + Next.js Storefront) or **Backend only**
    2. Optionally load **sample data** (products, categories, images)

    Once complete, your store should be running at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin). The port can be different if `3000` is already used on your system.

    See the full [create-spree-app documentation](/developer/create-spree-app/quickstart) for all CLI flags and options.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Installation">
    For developers who prefer full control over the setup, or want to add Spree to an existing Rails application.

    1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
    2. Install [vips](https://www.libvips.org/install.html) for image processing
    3. Install Rails gem:
        ```bash
        gem install rails
        ```
    4. Create a new Spree application:
        ```bash
        rails new my_store -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/spree/template.rb
        ```
        To use a specific database, pass the `-d` flag:
        ```bash
        rails new my_store -d postgresql -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/spree/template.rb
        rails new my_store -d mysql -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/spree/template.rb
        ```
    5. Navigate to the application directory:
        ```bash
        cd my_store
        ```
    6. Start the development server:
        ```bash
        bin/dev
        ```
    7. Optionally load sample data (products, categories, etc.):
        ```bash
        bin/rails spree_sample:load
        ```

    <Info>
      Spree works with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** databases. The Rails template defaults to SQLite for quick setup. You can switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL at any time. [Learn more about database configuration](/developer/deployment/database).
