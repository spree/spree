## Getting Started with Spree Commerce

Welcome to the Spree Commerce documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to build and deploy your Spree Commerce store.

### 1. Deploying Your Docs Repository

Spree Commerce are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our [starter template](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). We use Github to integrate your docs with your code, and make source control effortless.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Creating Your Documentation Repository">

    If you've created a docs repo in our onboarding, this step is complete. You can find your docs repository on your Mintlify [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    To create your docs repo without logging into Github, follow these instructions:
    1. Clone our [starter template](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) into a new public repo. You can make the repo private later.
    2. [Get in touch](mailto:support@mintlify.com) with our team to deploy your repo.

    ![Starter Template](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/starter-template.png)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Installing Our Github App">
  
    The next step is to install our Github app. This ensures that your updates are automatically deployed when you push changes. You can find the installation link in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings), on the Settings page. Upon successful installation, a check mark will appear next to the commit hash of the repository.

</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Updating Your Docs

Mintlify enables you to easily customize the style, structure, and content of your docs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up Your Editing Environment">
  
    **Edit Locally (Recommended for Developers):**

    1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
    2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using `git clone <your-repo>`. If you haven't set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    3. Use your favorite IDE to open the repository.
    4. Install our Mintlify CLI to preview changes with `npm i -g mintlify`. Learn more about this in our [development guide](/development).

    **Editing Online:**

    Here are two ways to edit your repository online:

    * To edit a single file, locate and click the edit button. This will open a web editor right on Github.
      ![Edit Online](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/edit-online.png)
    * For a more versatile online experience, open your git repository in Github's [github.dev](https://github.dev) online IDE. Simply replace `github.com` in your repo URL with `github.dev`. For example, use `github.dev/mintlify/docs` instead of `github.com/mintlify/docs`.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Customizing Your Brand (mint.json)">
  
    Easily customize colors, logos and buttons among other configurations in our `mint.json` file. Start with these basic configurations:

    ```json
    "name": "Your Company"
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo/light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo/dark.svg",
      "href": "https://yourcompany.com"
    },
    "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#2AB673",
      "light": "#55D799",
      "dark": "#117866",
    },
    ```

    A full list of supported configurations can be found [here](/settings/global).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Adding Content">

    Add content with simple MDX files. Initiate your pages with this template:

    ```md
    ---
    title: "Page Title"
    sidebarTitle: "Sidebar title (optional - if different from page title)"
    description: "Subtitle (optional)"
    ---
    ```

    Learn more about adding images, tables, lists, and more using the [MDX syntax](/content/text). We also offer a wide array of components which are listed [here](/content/components).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Pushing Your Changes">

    Once ready, commit and push your changes to update your docs site. Here is a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) on how to do that. If the Github app is unable to successfully deploy your changes, you can manually update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    ![Manual Update](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/manual-update.png)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Supercharging Your Docs

Mintlify supports an array of advanced features like API reference docs, analytics, and versioning to accommodate any of your documentation needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Generating API References">

    You can easily set up your API references using an OpenAPI document.

    1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into your docs repository or define the `openapi` field in `mint.json` with a URL.

    ```json
    "openapi": "link-to-your-openapi-file"
    ```

    2. Use our [scraper](/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) to autogenerate your OpenAPI endpoints files as:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
    ```

    3. Finally, include the generated endpoint MDX files to your `mint.json` under `navigation`.

    For a complete guide on using Mintlify with OpenAPI, check out [this guide](/api-playground/openapi/setup). [This guide](/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi) explains how to configure your API authentication methods. For manual API references definition, explore [our syntax](/api-playground/overview).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="star" title="Adding a Custom Domain">

    Integrate your docs into your website by hosting them on a custom domain. This is included even in the free Mintlify plan. Navigate to your [dashboard settings](https://www.dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) to add a custom domain.

    ![Custom Domain](/images/custom-domain.png)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-simple" title="Adding Analytics">

    Our in-house analytics give you insights into page views, search analytics, session recordings and more. Access these on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/analytics). We also support integrations with a range of analytics providers. You can find the list of providers [here](/integrations/analytics/overview).

  </Accordion>
