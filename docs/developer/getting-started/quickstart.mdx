<Info>
  Spree works with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** databases. The default setup uses SQLite for quick start. You can switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL at any time. [Learn more about database configuration](/developer/deployment/database).

## Installation options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="create-spree-app">
    The quickest way to get started. Scaffolds a full Spree application with a single command.

    **Requirements:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ (for the scaffolding tool only — the generated app runs on Ruby/Rails)

    ```bash
    npx create-spree-app@latest my-store
    ```

    The CLI will walk you through a few options (database, sample data, etc.) and set up everything for you — including Ruby, Rails, and all dependencies.

    Once complete, start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd my-store
    bin/dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Installation">
    For developers who prefer full control over the setup, or want to add Spree to an existing Rails application.

    1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
    2. Install [vips](https://www.libvips.org/install.html) for image processing
    3. Install Rails gem:
        ```bash
        gem install rails
        ```
    4. Create a new Spree application:
        ```bash
        rails new my_store -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/spree/template.rb
        ```
        To use a specific database, pass the `-d` flag:
        ```bash
        rails new my_store -d postgresql -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/spree/template.rb
        rails new my_store -d mysql -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spree/spree/main/spree/template.rb
        ```
    5. Navigate to the application directory:
        ```bash
        cd my_store
        ```
    6. Start the development server:
        ```bash
        bin/dev
        ```
    7. Optionally load sample data (products, categories, etc.):
        ```bash
        bin/rails spree_sample:load
        ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
