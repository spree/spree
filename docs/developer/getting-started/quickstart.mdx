<Info>
  Spree works with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** databases. The installer defaults to SQLite for quick setup. You can switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL at any time later. [Learn more about database configuration](/developer/deployment/database).

## Installation options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Spree Installer">
    Use the guided installer to set up your Spree application with all the required dependencies (system libraries, Ruby language) on your system.

    Copy and paste the following command to your terminal:

    ```bash
    bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://spreecommerce.org/install)"
    ```

    This will fire up the guided installer that will ask you a few questions (eg. application name, load sample data, etc.) and then set up your Spree application.
