## 2026-03-17: Rename StockItem → StockLevel
`Spree::StockItem` → `Spree::StockLevel`, `spree_stock_items` → `spree_stock_levels`.
Prefix ID: `si_` → `sl_`.

Every other platform uses "level" for this concept — Shopify (`InventoryLevel`),
Medusa (`InventoryLevel`), Vendure (`StockLevel`), Saleor (`Stock`). "Item" sounds
like a physical object; "level" correctly describes "the quantity of a variant at
a location."

Part of the 6.0 model rename wave. Includes renaming the FK columns
(`stock_item_id` → `stock_level_id`) on StockMovement, StockReservation, and
any other referencing tables.

## 2026-03-16: Rename user_id → customer_id on customer-facing models
As part of the User → Customer rename (6.0-platform-auth.md), rename `user_id`
foreign key columns to `customer_id` on all models where the FK references a
storefront customer (not an admin user).

**Rename to `customer_id`** (11 models — FK references Spree.customer_class):
- `spree_orders.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_addresses.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_credit_cards.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_store_credits.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_wishlists.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_gift_cards.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_gateway_customers.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_payment_sources.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_newsletter_subscribers.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_promotion_rule_users.user_id` → `customer_id`
- `spree_customer_group_users.user_id` → `customer_id`

**Keep as `user_id`** (5 models — FK references Spree.admin_user_class or is polymorphic):
- `spree_imports.user_id` — admin who ran the import
- `spree_exports.user_id` — admin who ran the export
- `spree_reports.user_id` — admin who generated the report
- `spree_state_changes.user_id` — admin who triggered the change
- `spree_user_identities.user_id` — polymorphic (Customer or AdminUser)

Single migration renames all 11 columns. Model associations updated:
`belongs_to :user` → `belongs_to :customer` with `class_name: Spree.customer_class`.

## 2026-03-16: PaymentMethod and DeliveryMethod become SingleStoreResource
Both PaymentMethod and DeliveryMethod (renamed from ShippingMethod) switch from
multi-store join tables (`StorePaymentMethod`, `StoreShippingMethod`) to
`SingleStoreResource` with direct `belongs_to :store`.

In practice, different stores have different currencies, zones, and provider
accounts — sharing the same payment/delivery config across stores is rare.
If a merchant wants the same config on two stores, they create two records.

Changes:
- Add `store_id` column to `spree_payment_methods` and `spree_delivery_methods`
- Data migration: for each join record, set `store_id`; duplicate methods linked
  to multiple stores
- Drop `spree_store_payment_methods` and `spree_store_shipping_methods` join tables
- Both models include `Spree::SingleStoreResource` concern

## 2026-03-16: Fix promotion rule/action STI namespacing
Rename `Spree::Promotion::Rules::*` → `Spree::PromotionRules::*` and
`Spree::Promotion::Actions::*` → `Spree::PromotionActions::*`.

The convention for STI subtypes is `Spree::{BaseClass}s::{Subtype}` — pluralized
base class as the namespace. Every other hierarchy follows this already:

- `Spree::PriceRules::VolumeRule`
- `Spree::Metafields::ShortText`
- `Spree::CollectionRules::Tag` (from categories plan)
- `Spree::ReimbursementType::Credit`

Promotion was the only one nesting under the parent model (`Spree::Promotion::Rules`)
instead of the base class (`Spree::PromotionRules`).

Changes:
- Move files from `app/models/spree/promotion/rules/` → `app/models/spree/promotion_rules/`
- Move files from `app/models/spree/promotion/actions/` → `app/models/spree/promotion_actions/`
- Data migration: update `type` column in `spree_promotion_rules` and `spree_promotion_actions`
  (e.g., `Spree::Promotion::Rules::Product` → `Spree::PromotionRules::Product`)
- Deprecation aliases for one release

## 2026-03-16: Normalize state → status across all models
Settle on `status` as the standard column name for state machines. Newer models
(Product, PriceList, PaymentSession, Import, Invitation) already use `status`.

Order.state and Adjustment.state are removed entirely by other 6.0 plans
(cart-order-split, split-adjustments). Five remaining models need a column
rename from `state` → `status` in 6.0:

- **Payment** — `state` → `status`
- **Shipment** — `state` → `status`
- **InventoryUnit** — `state` → `status`
- **ReturnAuthorization** — `state` → `status`
- **GiftCard** — `state` → `status`

Single migration renaming all five columns. State machine declarations updated
to `state_machine :status, initial: ...`. Deprecation aliases
(`alias_attribute :state, :status`) for one release.

Models already correct (no change): Product, PriceList, PaymentSession,
PaymentSetupSession, Import, ImportRow, Invitation, ReturnItem
(`reception_status`/`acceptance_status`), Reimbursement (`reimbursement_status`).

## 2026-03-28: Simplify metafield visibility — display_on → storefront_visible boolean (6.0)
Replace three-way `display_on` (both/front_end/back_end) with `storefront_visible`
boolean (default: true) on CustomFieldDefinition. `front_end`-only was already
excluded from `MetafieldDefinition::DISPLAY` and never made sense.

This makes the two-system boundary razor-sharp:
- Custom Fields (storefront_visible: true) = public structured data
- Custom Fields (storefront_visible: false) = admin-only structured data
- Metadata = private developer-owned data (never exposed)

Matches Vendure (`public: boolean`) and Saleor (`visibleInStorefront: boolean`).
Ships with the 6.0 model rename wave. See `5.4-6.0-custom-fields-rename.md`.

## 2026-03-16: Consolidate metadata — drop public_metadata, keep metadata JSON column
Drop `public_metadata` column (never exposed in Store API, unused). Rename
`private_metadata` → `metadata` in the database. Simplify the `Spree::Metadata`
concern to a single `metadata` JSON column with no alias indirection.

**Metadata** (JSON column) is a permanent, first-class system — the schemaless
developer escape hatch for integration IDs, sync state, ad-hoc flags. No
definition required, one-step API:
`PATCH /product { metadata: { erp_id: "123" } }`. Never exposed in Store API
(Stripe convention: write-only). Metadata is here to stay.

**Metafields** (→ Custom Fields in 6.0, see `5.4-6.0-custom-fields-rename.md`)
stay as merchant-defined structured data — typed values (short_text, number,
boolean, json, rich_text, long_text), require a `MetafieldDefinition`, have
`storefront_visible` boolean, searchable, CSV importable. With the
ProductType plan (6.0-product-types.md), metafields become schema-enforced
custom attributes driven by ProductType.

Two systems, two purposes, no overlap. No consolidation into one.
Metadata for machines, metafields/custom fields for humans.

## 2026-03-10: Product descriptions stay as plain column
Considered Action Text. Rejected for API-first performance —
serializing rich text adds overhead for every product response.
Also in the new Admin UI we will use TipTap for rich text editing.
