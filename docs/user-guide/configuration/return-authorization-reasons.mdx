# Return Authorization Reasons

### [Introduction](return-authorization-reasons.md#introduction) <a id="introduction"></a>

Before a return can be made, the user must describe the reason\(s\) why they wish to return their item\(s\). This is the place where you can create and name these reasons for your store.

Input the name that will be present during the Return process and click the **Create** button. It is not necessary to activate the Reason instantly. You can choose when you want to make a Return Reason active. For example you might want to create a Holiday refund reason - the user ordered something during holiday but wants to return it when you already deactivated this certain reason.
