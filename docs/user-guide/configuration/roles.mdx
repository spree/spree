# Roles

### [Introduction](roles.md#introduction) <a id="introduction"></a>

Roles are used to define users’ permissions on your website. This option gives you the ability to control the rights of users. By default, Spree offers two kinds of Roles: **Admin** and **User**. If you would like to create other roles with more specific features than the Admin and User roles, our company offers creating them for you, with the help of a little backend development work. To open the **Roles** tab, extend the **Configuration** dropdown and find **Roles**.

### [Creating a New Role](roles.md#creating-a-new-role) <a id="creating-a-new-role"></a>

To create a new role, click the **New Role** button that is placed in the upper right corner of the page.
