A message will appear asking you to confirm that you want to delete the product. Click “OK”.

### [Viewing](deleting-products#viewing) <a id="viewing"></a>

Deleted products no longer appear in the customer-facing area of your store. However, they do remain in your product database. To view products that have been deleted from your store, go to the “Products” tab in the Admin Interface and find the “Search” section. Do not enter anything in the “Name” or “SKU” fields. Check the “Show Deleted” box and click “Search”. The search results will return a list of your entire product inventory including active and deleted products.

### [Re-activating](deleting-products#re-activating) <a id="re-activating"></a>

To re-activate a deleted product, find the product in your inventory following the steps [above](deleting-products#viewing). Deleted products will only have the “Clone” icon next to them, whereas active products will have the “Edit”, “Clone”, and “Delete” icons next to them. Click the “Clone” icon to the right of the deleted product.

This will create a copy of the product, which will now appear in your product inventory list as “COPY OF” with the product name appended afterward. A new permalink and SKU will also be created for the product. Follow the instructions from the [Cloning guide](cloning-products) to modify the information for this product.
