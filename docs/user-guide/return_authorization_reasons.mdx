Input the name that will be present during the Return process and click the **Create** button. It is not necessary to activate the Reason instantly. You can choose when you want to make a Return Reason active. For example you might want to create a Holiday refund reason - the user ordered something during holiday but wants to return it when you already deactivated this certain reason.
