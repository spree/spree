Spree Commerce Enterprise Edition supports the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), enabling merchants to participate in ChatGPT Instant Checkout and other emerging AI eCommerce opportunities.

With structured feeds, seamless checkout, and full ownership of fulfillment and customer data, Spree gives merchants everything they need to power conversational commerce, without compromising flexibility, privacy, or brand control.

## Admin Capabilities

As a merchant or platform admin, you control how your products are presented to ChatGPT and how transactions are handled behind the scenes. With Spree, you can tailor every layer of the agentic commerce flow to match your operational setup and business goals.

### AI-Ready Product Feeds

- Generate structured product feeds compliant with ACP and other conversational commerce protocols.
- Automatically expose core product data (name, description, price, image, variants, etc.).
- Use metafields to enrich product records with AI-friendly, queryable attributes (e.g., “eco-friendly,” “carry-on size,” “for sensitive skin,” etc.).

### Product Discovery Optimization

- Add searchable properties or tags to make products easier to match with ChatGPT queries.
- Use metafields to define logic such as product use cases, customer types, target demographics, or recommended contexts.
- Group products into pre-defined collections to increase their discoverability in common buyer journeys (e.g. gifts under \$50, back-to-school).

### Checkout & Payments Integration

- Enable Instant Checkout using Spree’s built-in Stripe integration, fully compliant with ACP specs.
- Support one-click purchasing directly from the chat interface, even for guest users.
- Manage inventory, pricing, and availability across all channels, including ChatGPT.

### Order Handling & Fulfillment

- Orders placed via ChatGPT appear directly in the Spree admin dashboard for normal processing.
- Fulfill, track, and manage these orders just like any other, with no extra complexity.
- Support post-purchase flows (returns, refunds, customer messaging) under your control.

### Inventory & Catalog Rules

- Choose which products, variants, or collections should be eligible for conversational commerce.
- Automatically update feed content based on stock levels, lead times, or regional availability.

### Data Ownership & Insights

- You own all customer data, order history, and interaction logs.
- Spree allows you to segment and analyze ChatGPT-attributed orders like any other sales channel.

## Customer Experience

Buyers interacting with your brand via ChatGPT will experience a fast, intuitive, and AI-guided shopping flow - powered entirely by your Spree backend.

### Natural Discovery

- Customers describe what they’re looking for in their own words (e.g. “a vegan skincare set for dry skin under \$75”), and ChatGPT presents relevant products.
- Products are ranked by relevance (not paid placement) ensuring a high-quality shopping experience.

### Seamless Shopping

- View product details, pricing, images, reviews, and comparisons directly within the conversation.
- Initiate a secure checkout without ever leaving the chat.

### Frictionless Checkout

- Stripe powers the transaction, enabling one-click purchases via saved payment methods.
- Orders are confirmed instantly, and customers receive confirmation just like any other ecommerce flow.

### Post-Purchase Relationship

- The merchant handles all post-purchase interactions: shipping notifications, returns, support, upsells.
- Buyers benefit from consistent customer service and brand experience across every channel.

### Unified Account & Order History

- For returning customers, Spree supports unified accounts and saved payment methods that work across ChatGPT and your traditional storefront.
- Customers can manage orders and preferences from their standard dashboard if logged in.
