Spree Commerce Enterprise Edition gives your ecommerce business the tools to sell products directly through the ChatGPT chatbot, one of the fastest-growing AI search and discovery platforms in the world.

With ChatGPT Shopping, customers can find your products in real-time AI conversations and checkout instantly - all without leaving the chat. Spree supports this next-generation shopping experience with powerful product feeds, seamless Stripe payments, and full control over fulfillment, data, and customer relationships.

This new channel is powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open-source standard developed by OpenAI and Stripe. The result is simple: a smarter, more conversational way to shop.

## How does ChatGPT Shopping Work?

ChatGPT Shopping is a new way for users to discover and buy products directly inside a ChatGPT conversation. Instead of visiting a website, buyers ask for what they need and ChatGPT recommends products that match, based on real product data from merchants.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Discovery**: A user asks ChatGPT for a product recommendation, like “best noise-canceling headphones under \$200.”
2. **Selection**: ChatGPT shows a few options with pricing, images, and reviews - including products from your store.
3. **Checkout**: If your store supports Instant Checkout, users can purchase directly in the chat via a secure Stripe checkout flow.
4. **Fulfillment**: You process the order like normal and retain full ownership of the customer relationship.

It’s a frictionless experience that turns search into sales.

## Why Choose the ChatGPT Shopping Model?

### Reach New Customers Where They’re Already Searching

Millions of people are already using ChatGPT to explore product options. By making your store’s catalog available through ChatGPT, your products become eligible for inclusion - no ads, bidding, or rankings required. This is a free service.

### Convert Conversations into Checkouts

ChatGPT Shopping enables a direct buying experience with Instant Checkout. Shoppers can view, compare, and buy products, all without visiting a storefront or navigating a cart.

### Maintain Ownership & Fulfillment Control

You fulfill the order, own the customer data, and manage post-purchase support. The customer relationship remains 100% yours.

### Only Pay for Performance

There’s no cost to get your products in front of the ChatGPT users. You only pay a small fee when a sale is made, which is refunded in case of a return.

## Use Cases and Scenarios

- **B2C brands** - Tap into ChatGPT’s massive user base to get discovered organically for free. Shoppers searching for “best wireless earbuds under \$100” could land directly on your product.
- **Gifting and product discovery** - Buyers browsing for gifts or ideas (“eco-friendly skincare gifts for under $50”) are more likely to convert when the entire process is seamless and instant.
- **International expansion** - With ChatGPT’s multilingual capabilities, brands can reach global audiences and serve curated suggestions based on the buyer’s location or language.
- **Sustainable or value-based businesses** - Appear in relevance-based results like “eco-friendly backpacks.”
- **High-value product lines** - Ideal for premium or considered purchases (like luxury goods or electronics), where ChatGPT can guide shoppers through research and comparison before completing an instant checkout.
- **Niche catalogs** - Products that benefit from natural language search, e.g., “hiking gear for wet climates” or “skincare for sensitive skin.”

## Challenges & Considerations

While the opportunity is significant, conversational commerce is still evolving. Merchants should consider:

- **Data Structuring** - To appear in ChatGPT results, your product data needs to be complete, structured, and informative. That includes:
   - Rich descriptions
   - Accurate pricing and stock levels
   - Descriptive attributes (e.g., color, material, audience)
   - High-quality images
- **Feed Management** - Keeping feeds up to date with pricing, inventory, and variants is essential for a frictionless buyer experience.
- **Customer Experience**- While the AI handles product discovery, your brand still needs to ensure fulfillment, support, and loyalty workflows are seamless.
- **Payment Setup** - Stripe is required for Instant Checkout. You’ll need to set up your Stripe account to work with ACP and handle payouts and refunds.

## How Spree Supports ChatGPT Shopping

Spree Commerce Enterprise Edition provides everything needed to participate in ChatGPT Instant Checkout and the ACP ecosystem:

- **ACP Product Feed Integration** - Spree automatically generates and maintains a structured product feed compatible with ACP.
- **Instant Checkout Support** - Stripe-based checkout flows are integrated and compliant with ACP specifications.
- **Metafields** - Use metafields to enrich product records with AI-friendly, queryable attributes (e.g., “eco-friendly,” “carry-on size,” “for sensitive skin,” etc.).
- **Full Ownership** - You host the storefront, own the customer relationship, and maintain full control over your data and brand.
- **Extensibility** - Build custom logic, filters, and product eligibility rules to fine-tune how and when your products are included.
- **No Lock-In** - Because ACP is an open protocol, your team or agency partners can extend the integration as needed, without relying on a third-party middleware.
