Spree Commerce gives merchants complete control over the sale and delivery of digital products. Whether you're selling fully digital goods or offering downloadable add-ons, Spree provides a flexible and secure framework for instant delivery, gated access, and hybrid product configurations.

## Admin Capabilities

Spree provides merchants with robust tools to manage digital products alongside physical inventory. Whether you're distributing eBooks, music files, software licenses, or digital assets, Spree allows you to configure flexible delivery rules, streamline access, and maintain full control over the digital fulfillment lifecycle.

- **Flexible Product Configuration** - Create fully digital products or attach digital files to physical products.
- **Download Access Management** - Define limits for how many times a file can be downloaded and for how long download links remain active. 
- **Multiple Delivery Channels** - Offer download access directly on the confirmation page, in order emails, or via the customer's account area.
- **Digital-Only Checkout** - Assign digital SKUs to a “Digital” shipping category. When only digital items are in the cart, the delivery step is skipped to streamline the checkout flow.
- \*\*Link Control & Expiry - \*\*Set download permissions and expiry windows. Revoke access manually if needed to prevent abuse or for license changes.
- **Segmentation & Analytics** - Track digital product performance using Spree’s reporting tools. Segment buyers based on purchase behavior or file download activity.
- **Metafield Support** - Use metafields to attach structured metadata to digital products (e.g., license type, access level, product version). These can be queried for automation or integrations.

## Customer Experience

Spree makes buying and receiving digital products fast, intuitive, and secure. Customers enjoy instant access to downloads after purchase, without unnecessary friction or waiting. With options to retrieve files via email or their account dashboard, the experience is smooth and dependable - building trust and satisfaction with every order.

- **Instant Access Post-Purchase** - Download links can appear immediately after checkout and are also delivered via email or available in the user dashboard.
- **Frictionless Checkout Flow** - When purchasing only digital products, users skip shipping steps entirely, making checkout faster and more intuitive.
- **Secure & Transparent Downloads** - Customers see how many downloads remain and how long links are active. Links are secure and uniquely generated per order.
- **Ongoing Access via My Account** - Digital purchases remain available in the customer’s account (if enabled), allowing repeat access without needing to contact support.

## Flexible, Customizable Architecture

While many digital products features are available out-of-the-box in Spree Community Edition, the open-source foundation means you can extend and tailor the platform to your exact business model - whether that means custom commission logic, ERP integrations, or unique checkout flows.

Spree offers flexibility across all layers of the platform, from code-level customization to no-code configuration.
