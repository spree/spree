Spree Commerce provides robust tools for managing digital products, offering flexibility and control over how files are configured, delivered, and accessed. Whether you're selling standalone digital goods or bundling them with physical items, Spree helps you streamline digital product operations while maintaining security and customer satisfaction.

Below is a breakdown of the key capabilities available to store administrators.

## Flexible Product Configuration

- Configure any product to be digital-only, physical, or a hybrid (e.g., physical textbook with downloadable companion PDF).
- Attach digital files (PDFs, ZIPs, etc.) directly to the product variant or order.
- File management UI in the admin dashboard for uploading, replacing, and associating files.

## Download Access Management

- Set download link expiration (e.g., 3 days) and/or maximum number of downloads (e.g., 5 per order).
- Control when download links become available:
  - Immediately after payment
  - Manually after admin approval
  - Upon fulfillment or other triggers

## Shipping Step Bypass

- Assign a “Digital Delivery” shipping category to digital products.
- If a cart only contains digital items, the shipping step is skipped entirely for faster checkout.

## Automated Digital Delivery

- Send download links by email after order placement.
- Customers can also access downloads from their “My Account” dashboard after logging in.
- Admins can resend download emails or regenerate download links when needed.

## Order and Access Logs

- Track and manage:
  - Which files were downloaded
  - How many times
  - By whom (customer email/account)
- Useful for fraud prevention or usage auditing.

## Security and Permissions

- Files are stored securely and served via protected, time-limited download URLs.
- Non-public file access prevents direct linking or unauthorized downloads.

## Bundling & Promotions

- Bundle digital products with physical items or offer them as free gifts with purchase.
- Create promotions or discounts specific to digital goods.

## Custom Rules & Logic (Optional)

- Use Spree’s flexible architecture to create custom workflows, such as:
  - Requiring customer approval for certain file types
  - Generating personalized files (e.g., license keys or certificates)
  - Integrating with external file storage or DRM systems
