## What is Digital Product Commerce?

Digital product commerce refers to the sale and delivery of intangible goods online, i.e., items that don't require physical shipping. These can include:

- Ebooks, PDFs, music files, videos, or artwork
- Software licenses or activation keys
- Educational materials or course access
- Downloadable templates or design assets
- Digital components of a physical product (e.g., user manuals, bonus media)

Unlike traditional ecommerce, there’s no inventory to manage or shipping to coordinate, but there are unique considerations around access, licensing, delivery, and customer experience.

## Why Choose a Digital Product Model?

- **Instant Delivery & Global Reach** - Digital products are available immediately after purchase, enabling frictionless fulfillment and zero logistics overhead.
- **Operational Efficiency** - No warehousing, shipping, or returns processing, just secure file hosting and access management.
- **Flexible Product Structures** - Bundle digital goods with physical items, sell standalone files, or combine multiple digital assets in a single SKU.
- **Controlled Access** - Use built-in rules to limit downloads per customer, expire links after a period, and ensure compliance with usage restrictions.

## Common Digital Product Use Cases

- **Digital Downloads Only** - audio files, software, or ebooks sold directly through an online store.
- **Digital + Physical Bundles** - e.g., selling a hardcover book that includes a free digital PDF version.
- **Membership or Subscription Access** - gated digital content tied to recurring billing or customer groups.
- **Instructional Materials** - downloadable manuals, training resources, or product guides.
- **License-Based Sales** - activation codes, keys, or serial numbers delivered post-purchase.

## Challenges in Digital Product Ecommerce

- **Secure Delivery** - Preventing unauthorized sharing or reuse of download links.
- **Access Control** - Offering flexible but enforceable download limits (time-based or usage-based).
- **Mixed Cart Handling** - Managing checkout experiences when carts contain both digital and physical items.
- **Content Updates** - Ensuring buyers get access to the latest versions of digital products post-purchase.

## How Spree Supports Digital Products

Spree’s digital product system is designed to offer flexibility for a wide range of use cases while providing a smooth customer experience:

- **Fully Digital or Hybrid SKUs** - Attach digital files to any product—whether sold standalone or alongside physical goods.
- **Download Access Management** - Automatically provide access upon purchase via email, user dashboard, or both. Configure:
  - Link expiry (by time)
  - Download limits (by count)
  - Manual revocation or reactivation
- **Digital Shipping Category** - If a product is marked as “digital only,” the checkout flow automatically skips the shipping step, reducing friction and improving speed to delivery.
- **My Account Access** - Customers can retrieve purchased files anytime from their “My Account” dashboard, based on the access settings you configure.
- **Flexible Delivery Methods** - Whether you want to show the download link on the success page, in an email, or via account login only, Spree gives you control over how digital content is distributed.
