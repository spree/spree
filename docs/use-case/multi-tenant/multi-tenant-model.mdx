## What is a Multi-Tenant Commerce Platform?

A multi-tenant platform enables multiple independent businesses (tenants) to operate their own customized and on-brand storefronts or commerce instances from a shared backend infrastructure owned and operated by a single provider. 

Each tenant is logically isolated - managing their own products, orders, customers, and configurations - while benefiting from the central platform’s scalability, security, and updates.

## Why Choose a Multi-Tenant Architecture?

- **Centralized Efficiency**:
  - Single codebase and infrastructure powering multiple storefronts.
  - Simplified maintenance, upgrades, and security patching.
- **Flexibility and Convenience for Tenants**:
  - Per-tenant branding, theming, and configuration options with no or very little technical knowledge or effort.
  - Isolated data models ensure one tenant’s operations don’t impact others.
- **Economies of Scale**:
  - Reduced hosting and DevOps overhead.
  - Shared infrastructure costs across all tenants.
- **Enhanced Control**:
  - Platform owner retains full visibility and governance over tenant activity.
  - Ability to enforce global settings or policies (e.g., compliance, payment gateways).

## Common Multi-Tenant Use Cases

- **SaaS Commerce Platforms**: Enable independent merchants to launch their own stores under a white-label SaaS offering.
- **Franchise & Dealer Networks**: Empower franchisees or dealers with localized sites, while maintaining brand consistency and centralized operations.
- **Multi-Brand or Multi-Country Enterprises**: Manage separate storefronts for different brands or regional divisions (countries) under a single administrative layer.

## Challenges in Multi-Tenant Commerce

- **Data Isolation**: Ensuring tenants cannot access each other’s products, orders, customers, or analytics.
- **Per-Tenant Customization**: Supporting varied storefront themes and branding, payment methods, tax rules, and shipping zones.
- **Scalability**: Handling growing traffic and transaction volumes across multiple tenants.
- **Security & Compliance**: Meeting strict requirements for data privacy (GDPR, HIPAA) and accessibility (WCAG).
