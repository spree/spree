Spree Commerce Enterprise Edition provides a robust, API-first foundation for building multi-tenant platforms. 

While core features like tenant isolation and centralized management are universally useful and inherent to the architecture, Spree’s flexibility allows businesses to develop advanced multi-tenant capabilities unique to their own use case.

Whether you’re envisioning a tightly controlled network where the platform owner manages the branding, storefront look & feel, product catalog, payments, shipping, and customer service, or a hands-off model where tenants operate with full autonomy, Spree empowers you to tailor the experience. 

Some of the use-case-specific features described below would require some development effort on top of the existing multi-tenant platform.

## Super Admin Capabilities

As the central operator of a multi-tenant platform, the super admin has ultimate oversight and control. Spree’s architecture enables platform owners to provision tenant stores, enforce global policies, and configure the level of autonomy each tenant enjoys. 

Whether you prefer a tightly managed network, (e.g., controlling the tenant storefronts, products, payments, fulfillment, and customer service) or a fully decentralized model where tenants operate independently, Spree gives you the flexibility to design the governance structure that fits your business vision:

- **Tenant Management** - Create, configure, and manage tenant stores, with global settings and tenant-specific overrides.
- **Tenant Store Management Options** - Manage tenant stores individually by logging into each admin dashboard or through a centralized multi-admin interface for global actions.
- **Tenant Onboarding** - Build self-service signup flows or invitation-only store provisioning.
- **Master Catalog Options** - Offer a centralized product catalog for tenants or allow independent tenant catalogs.
- **Billing & Subscription Models** - Implement per-tenant billing via subscription plans, commission-based fees, or hybrids.
- **Centralized Payments vs. Tenant-Specific Payments** - Act as the merchant of record for all transactions or enable tenants to integrate their own payment gateways.
- **Shipping & Fulfillment Models** - Centralize fulfillment operations (e.g., from your warehouse) or allow tenants to manage their own shipping and logistics.
- **Global Analytics & Reporting** - Monitor tenant activity, revenue, and KPIs across all stores.
- **Branding & White-Label Tools** - Customize admin UI, emails, and storefronts for a fully white-labeled SaaS experience.
- **API Management** - Issue API keys for tenant-level integrations and control access scopes.

See [Super Admin Capabilities](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/use-case/multi-tenant/super-admin-capabilities) for a more detailed breakdown.

## Tenant Capabilities

Tenants on a multi-tenant platform benefit from an intuitive and fully isolated environment to run their businesses. With Spree, each tenant can manage their own storefront, products, orders, customers, and configurations - all without affecting other tenants. 

Whether operating with complete autonomy or within limits defined by the super admin, tenants have access to the tools they need to deliver a localized and branded ecommerce experience, supported by a robust dashboard and flexible APIs:

- **Tenant Dashboard** - Manage products, orders, customers, promotions, and reports from a tenant dashboard.
- **Storefront Theming** - Customize branding, logos, colors, and layouts for each storefront.
- **Catalog & Inventory Management** - Maintain independent catalogs or pull from a shared master catalog.
- **Payment & Tax Configuration** - Tenants can connect their own payment gateways and set tax rules for their regions.
- **Shipping Configuration** - Define tenant-specific shipping zones, rates, carriers, and fulfillment policies.
- **Policies & Legal Pages** - Tenants can manage their own privacy policies, terms and conditions, and return policies.
- **Analytics & Reporting** - Access tenant-scoped dashboards for sales, orders, and fulfillment insights.
- **Third-Party Integrations** - Connect marketing tools, CRMs, Payment processing or POS systems using tenant-specific API credentials.
- **Customer Management** - Handle customer accounts, returns & refunds, and marketing communications independently.
- **Promotions & Discounts** - Create tenant-specific campaigns, coupon codes, and loyalty offers.

## Customer Experience

For customers, a multi-tenant platform built on Spree delivers a seamless and familiar shopping journey, whether they’re exploring a single store or moving between multiple storefronts.

This consistency is especially vital for multi-brand enterprises looking to cross-promote their brands and drive loyalty across their portfolio. With support for localized content, flexible payment methods, and responsive design, Spree ensures customers enjoy a smooth, trustworthy experience in every tenant store:

- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first storefronts for seamless shopping on any device.
- **Localized Storefronts** - Each tenant can operate under its own domain or subdomain with localized branding and user experience.
- **Flexible Checkout** - Customers experience tenant-specific payment options, shipping methods, and policies.
- **Express Checkout & Payment Options** - including Apple Pay, Google Pay, installment plans, and payment links for quick, flexible checkout.
- **Notifications & Shipment Tracking** - send per-vendor email updates and provides a unified order view in the customer dashboard.

## Multi-Tenant Scenarios

No two multi-tenant platforms are alike, but they may share similar features and characteristics. Here are a few examples of general multi-tenant use cases:

- [**White-Label SaaS Commerce**](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/use-case/multi-tenant/white-label-saas) - Offer merchants the tools to launch fully independent stores on your platform.
- [**Franchise & Reseller Networks**](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/use-case/multi-tenant/franchises-and-reseller-networks) - Centralize brand control while allowing franchisees partial autonomy.

- **Pop-Up & Event Commerce** - Support temporary tenant stores for events and seasonal campaigns.
