## What is a Multi-Vendor Marketplace?

A multi-vendor marketplace is a platform that allows multiple third-party vendors to sell products through a single storefront that you operate earning a sales commission. Conversely, a marketplace customer may purchase goods from multiple vendors in a single order with a single payment. 

Unlike traditional B2C ecommerce sites that are managed by a single merchant, marketplaces aggregate offerings from many vendors, providing customers with unmatched choice and convenience as well as greater shopping confidence and trust in the post-purchase process.

## Why Choose a Marketplace Model?

This model is well-suited for businesses that:

- Want to scale product offerings without investing in their own inventory.
- Operate as platforms or aggregators (e.g., Etsy, Farfetch, or Faire) serving a specific niche or industry
- Offer highly curated or regional marketplaces that serve a specific community of suppliers and customers.
- Provide tools and infrastructure to empower vendors, such as storefront management, analytics, and fulfillment integrations.
- Provide Customers with greater shopping convenience, choice, and confidence.

## Challenges and Considerations

Launching a successful marketplace requires careful attention to:

- **Vendor onboarding & management** - ensuring a smooth and consistent process.
- **Product data quality** - harmonizing product listings across vendors.
- **Order splitting & payouts** - managing vendors’ orders fulfillment and financial flows to multiple parties.
- **Vendor permissions** - ensuring appropriate access levels across the platform.
- **Trust and quality control** - managing fulfillment, reviews, and customer service.
