## What is B2B Ecommerce?

B2B ecommerce (business-to-business) refers to commercial transactions between companies, rather than between a company and individual consumers. These storefronts serve business accounts with structured workflows, not casual shoppers.

B2B platforms typically feature:

- Role-based access and buyer teams
- Volume pricing, customer-specific rates, and payment terms
- Bulk ordering and order repeat functionality
- Restricted or gated storefront access
- ERP or procurement integrations

## Why Choose the B2B Ecommerce Model?

- **Streamlined Sales Operations**: Digitizing your B2B sales process reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and allows for faster order turnaround—especially for high-volume, repeat purchases.
- **24/7 Self-Service for Buyers**: Business buyers increasingly expect ecommerce-like convenience. A B2B storefront allows them to browse products, check prices, and place orders on their own schedule.
- **Account-Based Customization**: B2B ecommerce enables personalized pricing, product availability, and tax rules based on account, segment, or purchasing history.
- **Scalable Growth**: An ecommerce-driven sales channel can complement or even replace traditional sales teams—helping you scale operations to more accounts or regions without adding headcount.
- **Integration with Back-Office Systems**: B2B platforms often need to plug into ERPs, CRMs, and procurement systems to streamline fulfillment, invoicing, and customer management.

## Common B2B Use Cases

- **Wholesale Ordering Portals**: Buyers log into secure portals to access bulk pricing, submit large orders, and reorder frequently.
- **Buyer Organizations**: Multiple users (buyers, managers, finance) operate under one account with shared order history, role-based permissions, and organizational pricing.
- **Member-Only Storefronts**: Access requires approval. Anonymous visitors can’t see pricing or checkout. Sign-up forms can be customized for customer vetting.
- **Dealer / Reseller Portals**: Offer customized catalogs and prices by account. Resellers place orders directly and may access sales and inventory reports.

## Challenges in B2B Ecommerce

- **Role-Based Buyer Structures**: Supporting multi-user organizations with permissions and approval workflows adds complexity that most B2C platforms don’t account for.
- **Custom Pricing Logic**: B2B pricing often includes tiers, discounts, and customer-specific contracts. A flexible pricing engine is critical.
- **Gated Storefront Access**: Restricting visibility of products and pricing until account approval is a must for many B2B businesses.
- **Large Quantities, Repeat Orders**: Business buyers need to place large orders efficiently - often reordering from CSVs or previous orders.
- **ERP & Fulfillment Integration**: Orders typically need to flow into ERP systems, with real-time sync for inventory, shipping, and invoicing.
- **Regulatory & Contractual Complexity**: Tax exemptions, special terms, and compliance requirements (e.g. for regulated products or specific industries) must be supported.

## How Spree Supports B2B Commerce

Spree gives B2B teams the building blocks to tailor storefronts and workflows to match their specific business logic.

While many B2B features depend on custom implementation, Spree’s extensibility allows you to:

- Require signup or login before showing products or prices or allowing checkout
- Serve different catalogs or prices by customer segment or account
- Group users into buyer organizations with shared access but varied permissions
- Offer tiered pricing, bulk discounts, and volume-based promotions
- Implement order approval or quoting flows
- Enable reordering from past purchases or CSV upload
- Integrate with your ERP, CRM, or accounting platform via API

Spree’s goal is to provide the infrastructure and freedom you need to create a high-performing B2B experience without being boxed in by off-the-shelf tools.
