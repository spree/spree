description: "Learn how Spree empowers merchants to manage B2B buyers, pricing, and workflows with full flexibility."
---

As the operator of a B2B storefront, you have full control over how business buyers access your platform, interact with your catalog, and complete their purchases. Unlike B2C commerce, B2B environments often require complex account structures, custom pricing, gated access, and high-volume order workflows.

Spree Commerce Enterprise gives you the flexibility to tailor these experiences to suit your sales model - whether youâ€™re selling to independent retailers, distributor networks, or large procurement teams. From customer segmentation and pricing logic to fulfillment, tax handling, and integrations, Spree provides the foundational tools needed to configure and scale a powerful B2B platform.

<Note>
Some advanced capabilities may require a bit of custom development or integration work depending on your exact business needs.
