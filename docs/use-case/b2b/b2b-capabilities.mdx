Spree Commerce Enterprise Edition offers a flexible and powerful foundation for building custom B2B ecommerce platforms.

With support for customer segmentation, per customer or segment pricing logic, account hierarchies, and gated storefronts, Spree enables merchants to deliver tailored experiences for business buyers - whether serving small retailers, wholesale partners, or large procurement teams.

Many of the features listed below can be configured using Spree’s APIs and flexible architecture. 

<Note>Some advanced capabilities may require a bit of custom development or integration work depending on your exact business needs.</Note>

## Custom B2B Logic

- Deploy flexible permission models and checkout behavior across customer segments or accounts.
- Use Spree’s APIs to deliver custom buyer portals or back-office workflows within mobile apps or existing web apps.
