Spree Commerce Enterprise makes it simple to launch and manage multiple stores from a single backend and admin dashboard, while giving you full control over what’s shared and what’s isolated between them.

Whether you’re running regional storefronts, separate brand identities, or product-specific microsites, Spree’s multi-store architecture ensures operational efficiency, flexible configuration, and a unified customer experience, without the complexity of managing multiple platforms.

## Admin Capabilities

Spree gives store operators the flexibility to manage multiple storefronts from a single admin interface, while defining what should be shared and what remains isolated. Admins can:

- **Easy setup** - provision new stores instantly via the dashboard, each with its own custom domain and branding.
- **Cross-store sharing** - choose what to share between your stores.
- **Store-specific payment gateways** - support localized payment methods or region-specific accounts.
- **Per-store inventory visibility** - allow a product to appear in one store but not another.
- **Admin user permissions** - control access per store or across all stores.
- **Customize themes and pages per store** - allows design freedom within a unified architecture.
- **Store-specific integrations** - connect per-store third party tools like marketing or analytics.
- **Store-specific promotions** - configure promo’s for each store separately.

## Customer Experience

Shoppers can enjoy a seamless and localized experience even across multiple Spree storefronts. Highlights include:

- **Store-specific branding and layout** - maintaining clarity and identity for each regional or brand-based store.
- **Localized content and pricing by store** - including currency, tax logic, and shipping options.
- **Shared customer accounts** - allow shoppers to log in once and access their saved info across stores.
- **Saved payment methods** - users can reuse payment methods across stores, providing a frictionless checkout experience for returning customers.
- **Tailored promotions per store** - supporting unique marketing campaigns or regional offers.
- **Cart isolation** - carts and checkouts are kept separate per store

## Use Case-Specific Customizations

Depending on how the multi-store setup is used, businesses can apply different configurations and custom features:

- **Global vs. Regional Stores** - businesses can share a global product catalog and then localize only what’s needed (e.g., language, prices).
- **Brand Collections** - use multi-store to separate visually and operationally distinct brands while maintaining a shared backend.
- **Regulatory Isolation** - maintain strict separation of tax, privacy, and compliance settings across regions or countries.
- **Promotional Experimentation** - run different marketing strategies per store and compare performance centrally.
- **Content Flexibility** - use store-specific blog content, landing pages, and campaigns for better audience alignment.

## Flexible, Customizable Architecture

While many multi-store features are available out-of-the-box in Spree Enterprise, the open-source foundation means you can extend and tailor the platform to your exact business model - whether that means custom commission logic, ERP integrations, or unique checkout flows.

Spree Enterprise offers flexibility across all layers of the platform, from code-level customization to no-code configuration.

  - **Shipping & Tax** - define shipping zones, rates, and tax rules per market.
