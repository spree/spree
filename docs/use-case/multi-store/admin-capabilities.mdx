Spree Commerce gives admins the power to manage multiple ecommerce stores from a single unified dashboard, with full control over what’s shared between all stores and what’s store-specific. This flexible configuration allows teams to support region-specific catalogs, niche storefronts, or multi-brand ecosystems, without duplicating infrastructure or fragmenting data.

Here’s how Spree helps businesses rapidly launch, customize, and manage multiple stores from a single dashboard at scale:

## Store Creation & Configuration

- **One-Click Store Setup** - Quickly spin up new storefronts from the admin dashboard.
- **Custom Domains** - Assign unique domains (or subdomains) per store.
- **Theme & Page Isolation** - Each store can have its own look and feel, with independent content pages and themes.
- **Store Settings** - Define store name, default language, currency, logo, favicon, and more.

## Resource Sharing & Isolation

- Control how much each store shares with others:
  - **Shared Resources (optional)**:
    - Products and product groups (selectively assignable from a central product catalog)
    - Inventory locations and stock levels
    - Customers and customer segments
    - Shipping methods, rates, and markets
    - Payment methods and processors
    - Admin user access
  - **Isolated per Store**:
    - Orders, shipments, payments, refunds
    - Store credits and gift cards
    - Blogs and newsletter settings
    - Integrations (e.g., GA4, Meta Pixel)
    - CMS pages and custom themes
