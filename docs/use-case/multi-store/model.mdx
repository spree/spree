## What is Multi-Store Ecommerce?

Multi-store ecommerce allows a business to operate multiple storefronts using a single admin dashboard. Each store may have its own branding, catalog configuration, and domain, while sharing certain operational resources such as inventory, shipping methods, or customer accounts.

In contrast to multi-tenant architecture (where each tenant operates as an independent entity with strict data isolation), multi-store setups are typically used when one business entity manages all stores and wants to centralize backend operations.

## Why Choose a Multi-Store Model?

- **Centralized Operations**: Simplify storemanagement by operating all stores from a single admin panel.
- **Faster Expansion**: Launch new stores in minutes to test new markets, regions, or product lines.
- **Brand Differentiation**: Customize each store's design and domain while keeping operations unified.
- **Shared Resources**: Leverage shared products, inventory, shipping methods, and payment gateways across multiple stores.

## Example Use Cases

- **Multi-Brand Retail**: Operate distinct stores for separate product lines (e.g. fashion vs home goods).
- **International Stores**: Launch region-specific sites like `example.com/us`, `example.com/uk`, each with its own tax and shipping setup.
- **B2B & B2C Separation**: Serve wholesale and retail customers on different storefronts with tailored pricing and content.
- **Niche Sub-Stores**: Use curated storefronts to highlight seasonal campaigns, special collections, or collaborations.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Data Segmentation**: Deciding what should be shared vs isolated across stores (e.g. products, customers, inventory).
- **Theme Management**: Maintaining consistent branding while allowing design flexibility per store.
- **Localization**: Supporting different currencies, languages, and tax rules per region.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking KPIs and sales across stores from a unified dashboard.

## How Spree Supports Multi-Store

Spree's built-in multi-store functionality makes launching and managing new stores seamless:

- **One-Click Store Setup**: Create a new store in minutes via the admin dashboard.
- **Custom Domains**: Assign each store a unique domain or subdomain.
- **Shared Resource Configuration**:
  - **Shared**: Products, Locations & Inventory, Customers, Shipping Methods, Rates, and Markets, Payment Methods, Admin Roles (with per-store access)
  - **Not Shared**: Orders, Shipments, Payments, Refunds, Store Credits, Gift Cards, Blogs, Themes, Pages, 3rd-party Integrations
- **Flexible Storefronts**: Each store can have a different theme, layout, and content structure.
- **Per-Store Settings**: Tailor taxes, payment gateways, shipping rules, and currencies for each store independently.

Spree’s multi-store capability is ideal for businesses looking to expand their reach while minimizing complexity. It provides the freedom to differentiate storefronts without duplicating infrastructure - a powerful balance between brand agility and operational efficiency.
