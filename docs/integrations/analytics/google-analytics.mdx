Spree Commerce comes with a native Google Analytics 4 integration that allows you to track user behavior, sales performance, and marketing effectiveness across your store. 

With minimal setup required, you can gain valuable insights into how visitors interact with your site, which can help you make informed decisions to improve conversions, user experience, and overall business strategy.

<Warning>
  To set up the Google Analytics integration, you must have a Google Analytics account and an associated property.
</Warning>

## Installation

Before you can enable Google Analytics 4, it must be installed. To do so, you need to run the following command:

```bash
bundle add spree_google_analytics && bundle exec rails g spree_google_analytics:install
```

After that, make sure to restart your server if it was running.

## Connect Google Analytics

Sign in to your Spree admin dashboard and navigate to the **Integrations** tab.

Simply enter the **Measurement ID** from your Google Analytics account into the field and click **Create** to finalize the integration.

<Note>
  You can find the **Measurement ID** in the Home screen of your Google Analytics dashboard, if no data has been collected yet. Otherwise, it can be found by navigating to Admin settings \> Data Streams and then clicking on the property associated with your Spree site.
