Adyen is a global payment platform that enables businesses to accept payments across multiple channels and markets. It supports a wide range of payment methods, provides advanced fraud protection, and offers seamless checkout experiences for customers worldwide.

Before you can enable Adyen, it must be installed. To do so, you need to run the following command:

```

After that, you need to make sure to restart the server.

### Additional Settings

You can optionally configure the following settings for your Adyen payment method:

- **Name**: Customize the display name shown for this payment method on the storefront.
- **Display**: Choose where Adyen should be available:
  - Storefront only
  - Admin panel only
  - Both (recommended)
- **Auto Capture**: Decide whether payments should be automatically captured at the time of authorization (recommended), or manually captured later.
- **Active Status**: Enable or disable the payment method. Inactive methods are hidden from checkout but not removed.

### Test Mode

If you want to test your checkout flow without processing real payments, Adyen's test mode is a safe and effective way to simulate transactions. To enable it, simply switch your Adyen Customer Area to **Test mode** and paste the corresponding **test API credentials** into the payment method settings in Spree.
