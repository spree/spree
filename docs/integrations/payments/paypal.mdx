PayPal is an online payment system that allows you to send and receive money around the world. You can link your credit card, debit card, or bank account. You can also set up a PayPal Balance account.

## Installation

Before you can enable PayPal, it must be installed. To do so, you need to run the following command:

```bash
bundle add spree_paypal_checkout && bundle exec rails g spree_paypal_checkout:install
```

After that, you need to make sure to restart the server.

## Connect PayPal

Sign in to your Spree admin dashboard and navigate to **Settings → Payments**.

You should see your live and sandbox credentials. Copy API key into `Client ID` and Secret into `Client Secret`.

If you wish to test the PayPal payments before going live, copy sandbox credentials and select `Test Mode` option in Spree.
