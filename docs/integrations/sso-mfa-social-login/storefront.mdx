Enterprise businesses benefit from offering **customer-facing SSO and social login** because it streamlines the shopping experience and improves conversions. Customers prefer using accounts they already trust instead of creating new ones.

## SSO providers

There are many popular SSO providers, such as **Microsoft Entra External ID**, **Auth0**, **Okta**, and **Ping Identity**. Each provider may offer several services with different target use cases.

For example, Microsoft’s SSO ecosystem includes:

- **Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory)** → secures your **Spree Commerce admin panel** for workforce users.
- **Entra External ID (previously Active Directory B2C)** → secures your **Spree storefront** for customer-facing apps, with support for social logins like Google and Facebook.

<Note>
  For the purposes of this article, we are using **Microsoft** as the example provider.

## Why integrate SSO and Social Login for the Storefront

- **Used by shoppers**
- Integration with **Entra External ID (B2C)** or other customer identity providers enables frictionless sign-ups and sign-ins
- Benefits include:
  - Reduced cart abandonment
  - Faster checkout
  - Higher conversion rates
- Supports **social login options**: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple ID, Microsoft

## Get Started with SSO and Social Login

Each storefront integration must be scoped individually. Consider the following:

- **Required SSO provider**
  - Choose from Microsoft Entra External ID, Auth0, Okta, Ping Identity, or others. Your decision depends on features, ecosystem compatibility, and scalability needs.
- **SSO provider settings, including identity providers**
  - Each SSO platform has unique configuration settings (OAuth endpoints, certificates, client IDs). If you want to enable social logins, you’ll also need to configure providers like Google, Facebook, or Apple.
- **Scope: social login only vs. SSO + social login**
  - Decide whether you only want to add social login on top of Spree’s existing authentication or fully replace it with a unified SSO + social login solution.
- **Existing or planned Spree customizations**
  - Customized signup flows, checkout flows, or customer segmentation logic may impact integration design. These need to be factored in during scoping.
- **Spree and Ruby on Rails versions**
  - Ensure compatibility with your Spree and Rails versions. Older projects may need adjustments to take advantage of newer identity management features.
- **Identity governance requirements** (segmentation, customer role-based access)
- **User lifecycle management** (account creation, deactivation, syncing)
- **Security posture** (MFA for customers, adaptive login, fraud detection)
- **Compliance certifications required** (GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS)
- **Traffic scale and performance** (millions of customer accounts, peak season load)
- **Disaster recovery and redundancy** (failover, global availability zones)
- **Integration with third-party services** (marketing automation, CDPs, analytics, loyalty programs)
