# Spree Commerce Documentation project

This directory contains the documentation for Spree Commerce located at [https://spreecommerce.org/docs](https://spreecommerce.org/docs).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the documentation! We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to build the documentation.

To run the documentation locally, you will need to install the Mintlify CLI.

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

Then you can run the documentation locally with the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 4000
```

This will start the documentation server on port 4000. You can then view the documentation at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
