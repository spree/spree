* Added changelog (this file)
* Fixed tree control to search only for anchors, allowing images or other elements inside the controls, while keeping the control usable with the keyboard
* Restructured folder layout: root contains plugin resources, lib contains script dependencies, demo contains demos and related files
* Added prerendered option: If set to true, assumes all hitarea divs and classes already rendered, speeding up initialization for big trees, but more obtrusive
* Added jquery.treeview.async.js for ajax-lazy-loading trees, see async.html demo
* Exposed $.fn.treeview.classes for custom classes if necessary
* Show treecontrol only when JavaScript is enabled
* Completely reworked themeing via CSS sprites, resulting in only two files per theme
  * updated dotted, black, gray and red theme
  * added famfamfam theme (no lines)
* Improved cookie persistence to allow multiple persisted trees per page via cookieId option
* Improved location persistence by making it case-insensitive
* Improved swapClass and replaceClass plugin implementations
* Added folder-closed.gif to filetree example
