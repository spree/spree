= To Do

1. Perform "more efficient" checks: year_of_created_at = 2008 and month_of_created_at = 8. Should result in a "BETWEEN" statement utilizing the column indexes. Thanks Georg for letting me know about this.
2. Solve conflicts between scope joins and joins in the search (for old versions of AR). Also solve conflicts between joins and includes.
