v2.2. Various fixes.

v2.13. Merge various fixes for Rails 2.2.2.

v2.12. Improvements to the test suite; bugfixes for STI children (rsl). Remove fancy dependency system in favor of using Dispatcher::to_prepare every time.

v2.11. Rails 1.2.6 tagging generator compatibility; change test suite to use included integration app.

v2.10. Add :parent_conditions option; bugfix for nullified conditions; bugfix for self-referential tagging generator; allow setting of has_many_polymorphs_options hash in Configuration's after_initialize if you need to adjust the autoload behavior; clear error message on missing or improperly namespaced models; fix .build on double-sided relationships; add :namespace key for easier set up of Camping apps or other unusual class structures.

v2.9. Gem version renumbering; my apologies if this messes anyone up.

v2.8. RDoc documentation; repository relocation; Rakefile cleanup; remove deprecated plugin-specific class caching.

v2.7.5. Various bugfixes; Postgres problems may remain on edge.

v2.7.3. Use new :source and :source_type options in 1.2.3 (David Lemstra); fix pluralization bug; add some tests; experimental tagging generator.

v2.7.2. Deprecate has_many_polymorphs_cache_classes= option because it doesn't really work. Use config.cache_classes= instead to cache all reloadable items.

v2.7.1. Dispatcher.to_prepare didn't fire in the console; now using a config.after_initialize wrapper instead.

v2.7. Dependency injection framework elimates having to care about load order.

v2.6. Make the logger act sane for the gem version.

v2.5.2. Allow :skip_duplicates on double relationships.

v2.5.1. Renamed :ignore_duplicates to :skip_duplicates to better express its non-passive behavior; made sure not to load target set on push unless necessary.

v2.5. Activerecord compatibility branch becomes trunk: extra options now supported for double polymorphism; conditions nulled-out and propogated to child relationships; more tests; new :ignore_duplicates option on macro can be set to false if you want << to push duplicate associations.

v2.4.1. Code split into multiple files; tests added for pluralization check; Rails 1.1.6 no longer supported.

v2.4. Unlimited mixed class association extensions for both single and double targets and joins.

v2.3. Gem version

v1.1. File_column bug fixed.

v1.0. Tests written; after_find and after_initialize now correctly called.
