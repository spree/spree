=== Version 1.1.5 / 2008-09-28

IMPORTANT: use 'script/autospec' (or just 'autospec' if you have the rspec gem
installed) instead of 'autotest'. We changed the way autotest discovers rspec
so the autotest executable won't automatically load rspec anymore. This allows
rspec to live side by side other spec frameworks without always co-opting
autotest through autotest's discovery mechanism.

ALSO IMPORTANT: Rails v2.1.1 changed assert_select_rjs such that it doesn't
always fail when it should. Please see
http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/982.

* bye, bye translator
* Added proxy to cookies so you can set them in examples the same way you set them in controllers

* Support --skip-fixture in the rspec_model generator (patches from Alex Tomlins and Niels Ganser)
* Add mock_model#as_new_record (patch from Zach Dennis)
