== Version 1.1.0-RC1

Textmate Bundle users - this release adds a new RSpec bundle that highlights describe, it, before and after and
provides navigation to descriptions and examples (rather than classes and methods). When you first install this,
it is going to try to hijack all of your .rb files. All you need to do is open a .rb file that does not end with
'spec.rb' and change the bundle selection from RSpec to Ruby. TextMate will do the right thing from then on.

Shortcuts for tab-activated snippets all follow the TextMate convention of 2 or 3 letters of the first word, followed by the first letter of each subsequent word. So "should have_at_least" would be triggered by shhal.

We reduced the scope for running spec directories, files, a single file or individual spec in TextMate to source.ruby.rspec. This allowed us to restore the standard Ruby shortcuts:

CMD-R runs all the specs in one file
CMD-SHIFT-R runs an individual spec
CMD-OPT-R runs any files or directories selected in the TextMate drawer

== Version 1.0.8

Another bugfix release - this time to resolve the version mismatch

== Version 1.0.7

Quick bugfix release to ensure that you don't have to have the rspec gem installed
in order to use autotest with rspec_on_rails.

* Fixed [#13015] autotest gives failure in 'spec_command' after upgrade 1.0.5 to 1.0.6

== Version 1.0.6

The "holy cow, batman, it's been a long time since we released and there are a ton of bug
fixes, patches and even new features" release.

Warning: Spec::Rails users: In fixing 11508, we've removed the raise_controller_errors method. As long as you
follow the upgrade instructions and run 'script/generate rspec' you'll be fine, but if you skip this
step you need to manually go into spec_helper.rb and remove the call to that method (if present - it
might not be if you haven't upgraded in a while).

Warning: Implementors of custom formatters. Formatters will now be sent an Example object instead of just a 
String for #example_started, #example_passed and #example_failed. In certain scenarios 
(Spec::Ui with Spec::Distributed), the formatter must ask the Example for its sequence number instead of
keeping track of a sequence number internal to the formatter. Most of you shouldn't need to upgrade
your formatters though - the Example#to_s method returns the example name/description, so you should be
able to use the passed Example instance as if it were a String.

* Applied [#12986] Autotest Specs + Refactoring (Patch from Scott Tayler)
* Added a #close method to formatters, which allows them to gracefully close streams.

Modules are automatically included when described directly.

* Renamed Spec::Rails' rspec_resource generator to rspec_scaffold.
* Removed Spec::Rails' be_feed matcher since it's based on assert_select_feed which is not part of Rails (despite that docs for assert_select_encoded says it is).

* Better translation of should_redirect_to
* Fixed --colour support for Windows. This is a regression that was introduced in 0.9.1
* Applied [#10460] Make SpecRunner easier to instantiate without using commandline args

== Version 0.9.1

This release introduces #describe and #it (aliased as #context and #specify for
backwards compatibility). This allows you to express specs like this:

  describe SomeClass do # Creates a Behaviour
    it "should do something" do # Creates an Example
    end
  end

The command line features four new options that give you more control over what specs
are being run and in what order. This can be used to verify that your specs are
independent (by running in opposite order with --reverse). It can also be used to cut 
down feedback time by running the most recently modified specs first (--loadby mtime --reverse).

Further, --example replaces the old --spec option, and it can now take a file name of
spec names as an alternative to just a spec name. The --format failing_examples:file.txt 
option allows you to output an --example compatible file, which makes it possible to only 
rerun the specs that failed in the last run. Spec::Rails uses all of these four options 
by default to optimise your RSpec experience.

There is now a simple configuration model. For Spec::Rails, you do something like this:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
    config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false
    config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'
  end

You can now use mocha or flexmock with RSpec if you prefer either to
RSpec's own mock framework. Just put this:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :mocha
  end
  
or this:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :flexmock
  end

in a file that is loaded before your specs. You can also
configure included modules and predicate_matchers:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include SomeModule
    config.predicate_matchers[:does_something?] = :do_something
  end

See Spec::DSL::Behaviour for more on predicate_matchers

* Sugar FREE!
* Added [10434 ] Please Make -s synonymous with -e for autotest compat. This is temporary until autotest uses -e instead of -s.
* Fixed [#10133] custom predicate matchers
* Applied [#10473] Add should exist (new matcher) - Patch from Bret Pettichord
* Added another formatter: failing_behaviours. Writes the names of the failing behaviours for use with --example.

* Applied [#10410] redirect_to does not behave consistently with regards to query string parameter ordering (Patch from Nicholas Evans)
* Applied [#9605] Patch for ER 9472, shared behaviour (Patch by Bob Cotton)

* Several --format options may be specified to output several formats in one run.
* The --out option is gone. Use --format html:path/to/my.html instead (or similar).
* Spec::Runner::Formatter::BaseTextFormatter#initialize only takes one argument - an IO. dry_run and color are setters.
* Made Spec::Ui *much* easier to install. It will be released separately. Check out trunk/spec_ui/examples
* HTML reports now include a syntax highlighted snippet of the source code where the spec failed (needs the syntax gem)
* Added [#10262] Better Helper testing of Erb evaluation block helpers

== Version 0.8.2

Replaced assert_select fork with an assert_select wrapper for have_tag. This means that "should have_rjs" no longer supports :hide or :effect, but you can still use should_have_rjs for those.

== Version 0.8.1

Quick "in house" bug-fix

== Version 0.8.0

This release introduces a new approach to handling expectations using Expression Matchers.

See Upgrade[http://rspec.rubyforge.org/upgrade.html], Spec::Expectations, Spec::Matchers and RELEASE-PLAN for more info.

This release also improves the spec command line by adding DRb support and making it possible to
store command line options in a file. This means a more flexible RSpec experience with Rails, 
Rake and editor plugins like TextMate.

== Version 0.7.0

This is the "Grow up and eat your own dog food release". RSpec is now used on itself and
we're no longer using Test::Unit to test it. Although, we are still extending Test::Unit
for the rails plugin (indirectly - through ZenTest)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE IS NOT 100% BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE TO 0.6.x

There are a few changes that will require that you change your existing specs.

RSpec now handles equality exactly like ruby does:

# actual.should_equal(expected) will pass if actual.equal?(expected) returns true
# actual.should eql(expected) will pass if actual.eql?(expected) returns true
# actual.should == expected will pass if actual == expected) returns true

At the high level, eql? implies equivalence, while equal? implies object identity. For more
information on how ruby deals w/ equality, you should do this:

ri equal?

or look at this:

http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057

Also, we left in should_be as a synonym for should_equal, so the only specs that should break are the
ones using should_equal (which used to use <code>==</code> instead of <code>.equal?</code>).

Lastly, should_be used to handle true and false differently from any other values. We've removed
this special handling, so now actual.should_be true will fail for any value other than true (it
used to pass for any non-nil, non-false value), and actual.should_be false will fail for any
value other than false (it used to pass for nil or false).

Here's what you'll need to do to update your specs:
# search for "should_equal" and replace with "should_eql"
# run specs

If any specs still fail, they are probably related to should be_true or should_be_false using
non-boolean values. Those you'll just have to inspect manually and adjust appropriately (sorry!).

--------------------------------------------------
Specifying multiple return values in mocks now works like this:

mock.should_receive(:message).and_return(1,2,3)

It used to work like this:

mock.should_receive(:message).and_return([1,2,3])

but we decided that was counter intuitive and otherwise lame.

Here's what you'll need to do to update your specs:
# search for "and_return(["
# get rid of the "[" and "]"

--------------------------------------------------
RSpec on Rails now supports the following (thanks to ZenTest upon which it is built):

# Separate specs for models, views, controllers and helpers
# Controller specs are completely decoupled from the views by default (though you can tell them to couple themselves if you prefer)
# View specs are completely decoupled from app-specific controllers

See http://rspec.rubyforge.org/documentation/rails/index.html for more information
--------------------------------------------------
As usual, there are also other new features and bug fixes:

* Added lots of documentation on mocks/stubs and the rails plugin.
* Added support for assigns[key] syntax for controller specs (to align w/ pre-existing syntax for view specs)
* Added support for controller.should_redirect_to
* RSpec on Rails automatically checks whether it's compatible with the installed RSpec
* Applied [#6393] rspec_on_rails uses deprecated '@response' instead of the accessor

* Fixed [#6233] Colours in specdoc
* Applied [#6207] Allows --diff option to diff target and expected's #inspect output (Patch by Lachie Cox)
* Fixed [#6203] Failure messages are misleading - consider using inspect.
* Added [#6334] subject.should_have_xyz will try to call subject.has_xyz? - use this for hash.should_have_key(key)
* Fixed [#6017] Rake task should ignore empty or non-existent spec-dirs

== Version 0.6.4

In addition to a number of bug fixes and patches, this release begins to formalize the support for
RSpec on Rails.

* Added Christopher Petrilli's TextMate bundle to vendor/textmate/RSpec.tmbundle
* Fixed [#5909], once again supporting multi_word_predicates
* Applied [#5873] - response.should_have_rjs (initial patch from Jake Howerton, based on ARTS by Kevin Clark)

* Applied [#5815] active_record_subclass.should_have(3).records
* Added support in "rake stats" for view specs (in spec/views)
* Applied [#5801] QuickRef.pdf should say RSpec, not rSpec
* Applied [#5728] rails_spec_runner fails on Windows (Patch from Lindsay Evans).
* Applied [#5708] RSpec Rails plugin rspec_controller generator makes specs that do not parse.
* Cleaned up RSpec on Rails so it doesn't pollute as much during bootstrapping.
* Added support for response.should_have_tag and response.should_not_have_tag (works just like assert_tag in rails)
* Added new -c, --colour, --color option for colourful (red/green) output. Inspired from Pat Eyler's Redgreen gem.
* Added examples for Watir and Selenium under the gem's vendor directory.
* Renamed rails_spec_runner to rails_spec_server (as referred to in the docs)
* Added support for trying a plural for arbitrary predicates.  E.g. Album.should_exist(:name => "Hey Jude") will call Album.exists?(:name => "Hey Jude")
* Added support for should_have to work with methods taking args returning a collection.  E.g. @dave.should_have(3).albums_i_have_that_this_guy_doesnt(@aslak)
* Added [#5570] should_not_receive(:msg).with(:specific, "args")
* Applied [#5065] to support using define_method rather than method_missing to capture expected messages on mocks. Thanks to Eero Saynatkari for the tip that made it work.
* Restructured directories and Modules in order to separate rspec into three distinct Modules: Spec::Expectations, Spec::Runner and Spec::Mocks. This will allow us to more easily integrate other mock frameworks and/or allow test/unit users to take advantage of the expectation API.
* Applied [#5620] support any boolean method and arbitrary comparisons (5.should_be < 6) (Patch from Mike Williams)
 
== Version 0.6.3

This release fixes some minor bugs related to RSpec on Rails
Note that if you upgrade a rails app with this version of the rspec_on_rails plugin
you should remove your lib/tasks/rspec.rake if it exists.

* Applied [#5525] fix rake task path to spec tool for gem-installed rspec (patch from Riley Lynch)
* Fixed a teensey regression with the rake task - introduced in 0.6.1. The spec command is now quoted so it works on windows.

== Version 0.6.1
This is the "fix the most annoying bugs release" of RSpec. There are 9 bugfixes this time.
Things that may break backwards compatibility:
1) Spec::Rake::SpecTask no longer has the options attribute. Use ruby_opts, spec_opts and rcov_opts instead.

* Fixed [#4891] RCOV task failing on windows

This release makes an official commitment to underscore_syntax (with no more support for dot.syntax)

* Fixed bug (5292) that caused mock argument matching to fail
* Converted ALL tests to use underscore syntax
* Fixed all remaining problems with underscores revealed by converting all the tests to underscores
* Enhanced sugar to support combinations of methods (i.e. once.and_return) 
* Simplified helper structure taking advantage of dot/underscore combos (i.e. should.be.an_instance_of, which can be expressed as should be_an_instance_of)
* Added support for at_most in mocks
* Added support for should_not_receive(:msg) (will be removing should_receive(:msg).never some time soon)

== Version 0.5.16
This release improves Rails support and test2spec translation.

* Fixed underscore problems that occurred when RSpec was used in Rails
* Simplified the Rails support by packaging it as a plugin instead of a generator gem.
* Fixed [#5063] 'rspec_on_rails' require line in spec_helper.rb
* Added pre_commit rake task to reduce risk of regressions. Useful for RSpec developers and patchers.
* Added failure_message to RSpec Rake task

== Version 0.5.15
This release removes a prematurely added feature that shouldn't have been added.

* Removed support for differences that was added in 0.5.14. The functionality is not aligned with RSpec's vision.

== Version 0.5.14
This release introduces better ways to extend specs, improves some of the core API and
a experimental support for faster rails specs.

* Added proc methods for specifying differences (increments and decrements). See difference_test.rb
* Methods can now be defined alongside specs. This obsoletes the need for defining methods in setup. (Patch #5002 from Brian Takita)
* Sugar (underscores) now works correctly with should be_a_kind_of and should be_an_instance_of
* Added support for include and inherit in contexts. (Patch #4971 from Brian Takita)
* Added rails_spec and rails_spec_server for faster specs on rails (still buggy - help needed)
* Fixed bug that caused should_render to break if given a :symbol (in Rails)
* Added support for comparing exception message in should_raise and should_not_raise

== Version 0.5.13
This release fixes some subtle bugs in the mock API.

* Use fully-qualified class name of Exceptions in failure message. Easier to debug that way.
* Fixed a bug that caused mocks to yield a one-element array (rather than the element) when one yield arg specified.
* Mocks not raise AmbiguousReturnError if an explicit return is used at the same time as an expectation block.
* Blocks passed to yielding mocks can now raise without causing mock verification to fail.

== Version 0.5.12
This release adds diff support for failure messages, a HTML formatter plus some other
minor enhancements.

* Added HTML formatter.
* Added fail_on_error option to spectask.
* Added support for diffing, using the diff-lcs Rubygem (#2648).
* Remove RSpec on Rails files from backtrace (#4694).
* All of RSpec's own tests run successfully after translation with test2spec.
* Added --verbose mode for test2spec - useful for debugging when classes fail to translate.
* Output of various formatters is now flushed - to get more continuous output.

== Version 0.5.11
This release makes test2spec usable with Rails (with some manual steps). 
See http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails.html for more details

* test2spec now correctly translates bodies of helper methods (non- test_*, setup and teardown ones).
* Added more documentation about how to get test2spec to work with Rails.

== Version 0.5.10
This version features a second rewrite of test2spec - hopefully better than the previous one.

* Improved test2spec's internals. It now transforms the syntax tree before writing out the code.

== Version 0.5.9
This release improves test2spec by allowing more control over the output

* Added --template option to test2spec, which allows for custom output driven by ERB
* Added --quiet option to test2spec
* Removed unnecessary dependency on RubyToC

== Version 0.5.8
This release features a new Test::Unit to RSpec translation tool.
Also note that the RubyGem of the previous release (0.5.7) was corrupt.
We're close to being able to translate all of RSpec's own Test::Unit
tests and have them run successfully!

* Updated test2spec documentation.
* Replaced old test2rspec with a new test2spec, which is based on ParseTree and RubyInline.

== Version 0.5.7
This release changes examples and documentation to recommend underscores rather than dots,
and addresses some bugfixes and changes to the spec commandline.

* spec DIR now works correctly, recursing down and slurping all *.rb files
* All documentation and examples are now using '_' instead of '.'
* Custom external formatters can now be specified via --require and --format.

== Version 0.5.6
This release fixes a bug in the Rails controller generator

* The controller generator did not write correct source code (missing 'do'). Fixed.

== Version 0.5.5
This release adds initial support for Ruby on Rails in the rspec_generator gem.

* [Rails] Reorganised Lachie's original code to be a generator packaged as a gem rather than a plugin.
* [Rails] Imported code from http://lachie.info/svn/projects/rails_plugins/rspec_on_rails (Written by Lachie Cox)
* Remove stack trace lines from TextMate's Ruby bundle
* Better error message from spectask when no spec files are found.
