= AwesomeNestedSet

Awesome Nested Set is an implementation of the nested set pattern for ActiveRecord models. It is replacement for acts_as_nested_set and BetterNestedSet, but awesomer. It supports Rails 2.1 and later.

== What makes this so awesome?

This is a new implementation of nested set based off of BetterNestedSet that fixes some bugs, removes tons of duplication, adds a few useful methods, and adds STI support.

== Installation

Install as a plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set.git
  
== Usage

To make use of awesome_nested_set, your model needs to have 3 fields: lft, rgt, and parent_id:

  class CreateCategories < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :categories do |t|
        t.string :name
        t.integer :parent_id
        t.integer :lft
        t.integer :rgt
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :categories
    end
  end

Enable the nested set functionality by declaring acts_as_nested_set on your model

  class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set
  end
  
Run `rake rdoc` to generate the API docs and see CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet::SingletonMethods for more info.

== View Helper

The view helper is called #nested_set_options. 

Example usage:

  <%= f.select :parent_id, nested_set_options(Category, @category) {|i| "#{'-' * i.level} #{i.name}" } %>

  <%= select_tag 'parent_id', options_for_select(nested_set_options(Category) {|i| "#{'-' * i.level} #{i.name}" } ) %>

See CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet::Helper for more information about the helpers.
