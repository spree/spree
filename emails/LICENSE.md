## License Overview

For **Spree Commerce versions 4.10 and later** in the [spree/spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) repository, **two licenses apply simultaneously**, and users must comply with both at the same time:

- [**AGPL-3.0**](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) – for all contributions from version 4.10 onwards  
- [**BSD-3-Clause**](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) – for all contributions predating version 4.10  

Effectively, for versions **4.10 and upwards**, the **AGPL-3.0 license** applies.

**Spree Commerce versions 4.9 and earlier** are available under the **BSD-3-Clause** license, and users must comply with its terms.

If you’d like to use Spree Commerce without AGPL-3.0 restrictions (for example, for a **SaaS business**), please contact us to obtain a [Commercial License](#commercial-license).

All third-party components incorporated into this software are licensed under the original license provided by the owner of that component.
