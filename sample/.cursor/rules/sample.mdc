  # Create taxonomies first
  clothing = Spree::Taxonomy.create!(name: 'Clothing')
  brands = Spree::Taxonomy.create!(name: 'Brands')
  
  # Create taxons
  shirts = clothing.root.children.create!(name: 'Shirts')
  pants = clothing.root.children.create!(name: 'Pants')
  
  # Create products with proper associations
  product = Spree::Product.create!(
    name: 'Sample T-Shirt',
    description: 'A comfortable cotton t-shirt',
    available_on: Time.current,
    meta_keywords: 'shirt, cotton, comfortable',
    shipping_category: shipping_category
  )
  
  # Create variants
  product.variants.create!(
    sku: 'SHIRT-SM-BLU',
    price: 19.99,
    cost_price: 8.00,
    weight: 0.5
