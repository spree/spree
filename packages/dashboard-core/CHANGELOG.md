### Minor Changes

- [#14342](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/14342) [`202d846`](https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/202d846374270c75e19b23cea5498ea559577f67) Thanks [@damianlegawiec](https://github.com/damianlegawiec)! - Add per-channel order routing rule management. `@spree/admin-sdk` gains `channels.orderRoutingRules.{list,get,create,update,delete}` (nested under `/channels/:channel_id/order_routing_rules`) plus `orderRoutingRules.types()` for rule-kind discovery; the admin `Store` type now exposes `preferred_order_routing_strategy`. The dashboard's channel edit sheet embeds a routing-rules editor — drag-to-reorder priority, per-rule active toggles, an "Add rule" picker fed by the types endpoint (offering only kinds not yet on the channel; rule kinds are unique per channel), and schema-driven preference forms for rule kinds that declare preferences. The editor renders only when the channel's effective routing strategy is Rules. `Subject.OrderRoutingRule` is available for permission checks.

- [#14341](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/14341) [`dc33237`](https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/dc332372b918ffeb92252c33372a1d71a221a7d4) Thanks [@damianlegawiec](https://github.com/damianlegawiec)! - Improve editing of quantity-bounded price rules. A blank upper-bound preference (`max_quantity`, `max_uses`, `maximum_amount`, …) now shows "Unlimited" instead of an empty required-looking field across every preferences form. The Volume price rule gains a dedicated editor that renders minimum quantity before maximum, so a case-pack minimum reads in a natural order.

### Patch Changes

- Fix the collapsed icon sidebar leaking a nav item's label when the item carries a badge. The collapse rule hid only the last `span` of the menu button, and a trailing badge took that slot — the label stayed visible and wrapped, breaking the collapsed layout. Both the label and badge are now hidden explicitly in collapsed icon mode.
