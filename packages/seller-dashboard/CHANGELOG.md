# @spree/seller-dashboard

## 1.0.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- [`35fb9e8`](https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/35fb9e8868718420bab03142b2d9990fefa18dc7) Thanks [@damianlegawiec](https://github.com/damianlegawiec)! - Pinned Base UI to an exact version so a scaffolded dashboard boots.

  `@base-ui/react` was caret-ranged, so every new project installed whatever Base UI had published most recently rather than the version Spree tested against. `@base-ui/utils` 0.3.0 added a `useStore` helper that imports `useSyncExternalStore` by name from the CommonJS `use-sync-external-store` shim. Vite converts that during prebundling for an ordinary dependency, but `@spree/dashboard-ui` ships source, so an installed copy reached the browser with the named CommonJS import intact and the dashboard failed to start with a `SyntaxError`.

  The monorepo's committed lockfile hid this — only fresh installs floated onto the newer Base UI. It is now pinned exactly, in the packages and as a workspace override, and the monorepo runs the same version a scaffold installs.

### Patch Changes

- [#14736](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/14736) [`e601826`](https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/e601826eb3cc701bc918ae7ddb9c2c52598e02d7) Thanks [@damianlegawiec](https://github.com/damianlegawiec)! - Invitation listings no longer include `acceptance_url`, because the link carries the token that accepts the invitation. Fetch it on demand with `invitations.acceptanceLink(id)` (and `sellers.invitations.acceptanceLink(sellerId, id)` in the Admin SDK), which needs write access. The "Copy invitation link" actions in the dashboard and the seller panel now use it.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- [#14667](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/14667) [`53008b4`](https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/53008b4a30eeca633206e726f0303f1f8c0673d3) Thanks [@damianlegawiec](https://github.com/damianlegawiec)! - Re-export the framework and the design system, so an application has one import to remember.

  `@spree/dashboard` and `@spree/seller-dashboard` now expose everything from `@spree/dashboard-core` and `@spree/dashboard-ui`, and a host app writing its own pages no longer has to work out which package `useStore`, `Button` or `defineTable` lives in. Both packages stay importable directly, which is what a distributed plugin still does — it extends the shell rather than shipping it.

  A few names exist in both packages, where the design system ships a presentational component and the framework wraps it with data. `export *` drops such a name rather than picking one, so `ResourceCombobox`, `ResourceMultiAutocomplete`, `Slot`, `StatusCard` and `DateRange` resolved to the design system's version and the data-fetching one was unreachable through the shell. They are now re-exported explicitly, and a test fails when a new duplicate appears.

  - @spree/dashboard-ui@1.0.0-beta.3

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- Removed the address map from the design system.

  The map was rendered on one card — a seller's billing and returns addresses — and could not plot anything, because Spree addresses carry no coordinates. It also cost every dashboard user around a megabyte of MapLibre in the main bundle.

  Its `?worker&url` import made the package impossible to install, too: Vite's dependency optimizer cannot resolve that specifier inside `node_modules`, so any project depending on `@spree/dashboard-ui` failed to start its dev server. Projects on the previous release should upgrade.
