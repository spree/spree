Spree Commerce is a free, open-source eCommerce framework giving you full control and customizability.  

For **Spree Commerce versions 4.10** and later in the [spree/spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) repository, **two licenses apply simultaneously**, and users are required to comply with the terms of both licenses at the same time:

- [AGPL-3.0](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) – for all contributions from version 4.10 onwards  
- [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) – for all contributions predating version 4.10  

Effectively, for versions 4.10 and upwards, the **AGPL-3.0 license applies**.  

**Spree Commerce versions 4.9 and earlier** in the [spree/spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) repository are available under the **BSD-3-Clause license**, and users are required to comply with its terms.  

If you’d like to use Spree Commerce without the AGPL-3.0 restrictions (e.g., for a **SaaS business**), please contact us about obtaining a [Commercial License](#commercial-license).  

All third-party components incorporated into this software are licensed under the original license provided by the owner of the applicable component.  

Please refer to our [Licensing FAQ](https://spreecommerce.org/why-spree-is-changing-its-open-source-license-to-agpl-3-0-and-introducing-a-commercial-license/) if you have questions.
