  module PromotionHandler
    # Decides which promotion should be activated given the current order context
    #
    # By activated it doesn't necessarily mean that the order will have a
    # discount for every activated promotion. It means that the discount will be
    # created and might eventually become eligible. The intention here is to
    # reduce overhead. e.g. a promotion that requires item A to be eligible
    # shouldn't be eligible unless item A is added to the order.
    #
    # It can be used as a wrapper for custom handlers as well. Different
    # applications might have completely different requirements to make
    # the promotions system accurate and performant. Here they can plug custom
    # handler to activate promos as they wish once an item is added to cart
