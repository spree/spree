# One of the magic features that that engines plugin provides is the ability to
# override selected methods in controllers and helpers from your application.
# This is achieved by trapping requests to load those files, and then mixing in
# code from plugins (in the order the plugins were loaded) before finally loading
# any versions from the main +app+ directory.
#
# The behaviour of this extension is output to the log file for help when
# debugging.
#
# == Example
#
# A plugin contains the following controller in <tt>plugin/app/controllers/my_controller.rb</tt>:
#
#   class MyController < ApplicationController
#     def index
#       @name = "HAL 9000"
#     end
#     def list
#       @robots = Robot.find(:all)
#     end
#   end
#
# In one application that uses this plugin, we decide that the name used in the
# index action should be "Robbie", not "HAL 9000". To override this single method,
# we create the corresponding controller in our application 
# (<tt>RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/my_controller.rb</tt>), and redefine the method:
#
#   class MyController < ApplicationController
#     def index
#       @name = "Robbie"
#     end
#   end
#
# The list method remains as it was defined in the plugin controller.
#
# The same basic principle applies to helpers, and also views and partials (although
# view overriding is performed in Engines::RailsExtensions::Templates; see that
# module for more information).
#
# === What about models?
#
# Unfortunately, it's not possible to provide this kind of magic for models.
# The only reason why it's possible for controllers and helpers is because
# they can be recognised by their filenames ("whatever_controller", "jazz_helper"),
# whereas models appear the same as any other typical Ruby library ("node",
# "user", "image", etc.). 
#
# If mixing were allowed in models, it would mean code mixing for *every* 
# file that was loaded via +require_or_load+, and this could result in
# problems where, for example, a Node model might start to include 
# functionality from another file called "node" somewhere else in the
# <tt>$LOAD_PATH</tt>.
#
# One way to overcome this is to provide model functionality as a module in
# a plugin, which developers can then include into their own model
# implementations.
#
# Another option is to provide an abstract model (see the ActiveRecord::Base
# documentation) and have developers subclass this model in their own
# application if they must.
#

#
# The Engines::RailsExtensions::Dependencies module includes a method to
# override Dependencies.require_or_load, which is called to load code needed
# by Rails as it encounters constants that aren't defined.
#
# This method is enhanced with the code-mixing features described above.

  # helpers to override single methods from those in plugins.

  # locations. Finally, the application version is loaded, using Ruby's behaviour
  # to replace existing methods with their new definitions.
