# == Parameters
#
# The Engines module has a number of public configuration parameters:
#
# [+public_directory+]  The directory into which plugin assets should be
#                       mirrored. Defaults to <tt>RAILS_ROOT/public/plugin_assets</tt>.
# [+schema_info_table+] The table to use when storing plugin migration 
#                       version information. Defaults to +plugin_schema_info+.
#
# Additionally, there are a few flags which control the behaviour of
# some of the features the engines plugin adds to Rails:
#
# [+disable_application_view_loading+] A boolean flag determining whether
#                                      or not views should be loaded from 
#                                      the main <tt>app/views</tt> directory.
#                                      Defaults to false; probably only 
#                                      useful when testing your plugin.
# [+disable_application_code_loading+] A boolean flag determining whether
#                                      or not to load controllers/helpers 
#                                      from the main +app+ directory,
#                                      if corresponding code exists within 
#                                      a plugin. Defaults to false; again, 
#                                      probably only useful when testing 
#                                      your plugin.
# [+disable_code_mixing+] A boolean flag indicating whether all plugin
#                         copies of a particular controller/helper should 
#                         be loaded and allowed to override each other, 
#                         or if the first matching file should be loaded 
#                         instead. Defaults to false.

    # The engines plugin will, by default, mix code from controllers and helpers,
    # allowing application code to override specific methods in the corresponding
    # controller or helper classes and modules. However, if other file types should
    # also be mixed like this, they can be added by calling this method. For example,
    # if you want to include "things" within your plugin and override them from
    # your applications, you should use the following layout:
    #
    #   app/
    #    +-- things/
    #    |       +-- one_thing.rb
    #    |       +-- another_thing.rb
    #   ...
    #   vendor/
    #       +-- plugins/
    #                +-- my_plugin/
    #                           +-- app/
    #                                +-- things/
    #                                        +-- one_thing.rb
    #                                        +-- another_thing.rb
    #
    # The important point here is that your "things" are named <whatever>_thing.rb,
    # and that they are placed within plugin/app/things (the pluralized form of 'thing').
    # 
    # It's important to note that you'll also want to ensure that the "things" are
    # on your load path in your plugin's init.rb:
    #
    #   Rails.plugins[:my_plugin].code_paths << "app/things"
