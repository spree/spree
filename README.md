* [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) - for all other contributions predating version 4.10

Effectively, for versions 4.10 and upwards **AGPL-3.0** license applies.

Spree Commerce versions 4.9 and earlier in the [spree/spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) repository are available under the BSD-3-Clause license and users are required to comply with its terms.

All third party components incorporated into this software are licensed under the original license provided by the owner of the applicable component.
