Spree Commerce is a free, open-source eCommerce framework giving you full control and customizability.

For Spree Commerce versions 4.10 and later in the [spree/spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) repository two licenses apply simultaneously and users are required to comply with the terms of these two licenses at the same time:

* [AGPL-3.0](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) - for all contributions from version 4.10 onwards

* [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) - for all other contributions predating version 4.10

Effectively, for versions 4.10 and upwards **AGPL-3.0** license applies.

Spree Commerce versions 4.9 and earlier in the [spree/spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) repository are available under the BSD-3-Clause license and users are required to comply with its terms.

If you’d like to use Spree Commerce without the AGPL-3.0 restrictions e.g. for a SaaS business, please talk to us about obtaining a [Commercial License](LICENSE.md#commercial-license).
